That platform, of course, is WordPress!</p>\n<p>In this post, we will look at six reasons why WordPress should be the go-to publishing choice for your website, but first of all, let&#8217;s look at exactly what WordPress is, along with a little back history.</p>\n<h2>What Is WordPress?</h2>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403465" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wordpress-logo-1.png" alt="WordPress logo" width="1080" height="246" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wordpress-logo-1.png 1080w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wordpress-logo-1-300x68.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wordpress-logo-1-768x175.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wordpress-logo-1-1024x233.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></figure>\n<p>Put simply, WordPress is a platform for publishing self-hosted websites. Its interface is accessed through your web browser and other than using a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client for the initial install, WordPress offers you everything you need to publish your content. In fact, if you <a href="https://theme-fusion.com/hosting/" target="_blank">choose the right host</a>, you wouldn&#8217;t even need an FTP client.</p>\n<p>WordPress was first launched in 2003 by two developers who wanted a better solution for publishing their blog content (<a href="http://ma.tt/" target="_blank">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href="https://mikelittle.org/" target="_blank">Mike Little</a>). 13 years later, WordPress has now grown to power over <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y" target="_blank">25% of the internet</a> – with high-profile users such as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, the <em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a></em>, and <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/" target="_blank">BBC America</a>, to name a few.</p>\n<p>Its humble beginnings solely as a blogging platform are still present, but constant development has meant WordPress has evolved into a full-featured Content Management System (CMS). With developments such as the incoming <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/" target="_blank">REST API</a> on the horizon, WordPress looks to become even more dominant in the future.</p>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ve briefly looked at its history, let&#8217;s take a deeper look at some of the reasons you should choose WordPress as your publishing platform.</p>\n<h2>1. WordPress Is Open-Source and Free Forever</h2>\n<p>You may have heard the term &#8216;open-source software&#8217; bandied around, but might not know what it means. Quite simply, open-source means anybody can contribute to the software in question, with all of the source code freely available to download and modify. In a lot of cases, open-source software is free to use. You may already be using open-source software without realizing it, such as the <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank">VLC media player</a>, or the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox" target="_blank">Firefox browser</a>:</p>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-403033" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mozilla-firefox-homepage.png" alt="The Mozilla Firefox homepage." width="633" height="387" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mozilla-firefox-homepage.png 1942w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mozilla-firefox-homepage-300x184.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mozilla-firefox-homepage-768x470.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mozilla-firefox-homepage-1024x626.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></figure>\n<p>An important aspect of WordPress&#8217; freedom is its protection under what&#8217;s known as the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">GNU General Public Licence (GPL)</a>. This licence lets anybody use, share and modify the software. Also, in contrast to a standard copyright, any derived works must also be released under the GPL. What this means is WordPress is free, and will be freely available forever.</p>\n<p>While WordPress is highly unlikely to be unsupported in the future (WordPress&#8217; parent company Automattic was <a href="http://time.com/88025/wordpress-parent-automattic-joins-the-billion-dollar-club/" target="_blank">recently valued at $1–2 Billion</a>, and the CMS is the cornerstone of their business), its open-source nature means other developers are free to take over the project if development is halted. Plus, because of the GPL, they too would have to make their work freely available.</p>\n<h2>2. You Don&#8217;t Have to Be a Web Developer</h2>\n<p>There are a multitude of ways in which WordPress&#8217; design makes it easy to create pages and content, all without requiring any coding experience. In WordPress, each page or post is created using the open-source <a href="https://www.tinymce.com/" target="_blank">TinyMCE editor</a>. This gives WordPress the functionality of software like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, meaning styling your text with bold or italics, for example, can be done directly within the editor:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tinymce-editor.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-403034" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tinymce-editor.png" alt="An example of the TinyMCE editor." width="633" height="226" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tinymce-editor.png 2348w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tinymce-editor-300x107.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tinymce-editor-768x274.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tinymce-editor-1024x365.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a>Media can be embedded in a couple of ways. The Media Library enables you to add images using the <em>Add Media</em> button and can be resized directly within WordPress, so there&#8217;s no need for external programs such as Photoshop. &#8216;Under the hood&#8217; functionality also enables you to embed video from the likes of YouTube and Vimeo:</p>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-403035 aligncenter" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/video-embed-gif.gif" alt="A GIF showing the video embed process in the TinyMCE editor." width="640" height="365" /></p>\n<p>There are many more examples of WordPress&#8217; ease of use, such as the infamous <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install" target="_blank">five-minute install</a> procedure, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates" target="_blank">automatic updates</a> and its myriad of <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_General_Screen" target="_blank">social sharing and user interaction</a> settings, among others, the content editing options are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<h2>3. Designing Your Site Requires No Coding Skills</h2>\n<p>Your website&#8217;s overall design and layout doesn&#8217;t require the knowledge of your garden variety web developer either. For a start, WordPress includes several default themes designed to show off its core functionality. While these themes perform admirably, there are thousands of other themes to choose from, all completely free, within the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank">WordPress Theme Directory</a>. </p>\n<p>Because they&#8217;re free, you&#8217;ll find that the quality of themes varies. However, the Theme Directory includes a five-star rating system, awarded by users, to help you make an informed choice.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-403037" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-theme-directory.png" alt="The WordPress.org Theme Directory" width="633" height="370" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-theme-directory.png 1956w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-theme-directory-300x175.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-theme-directory-768x449.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-theme-directory-1024x599.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></p>\n<p>There are also some developers who offer premium themes (i.e. ones with a cost attached) with a generally more committed development program and dedicated support. <a href="http://themeforest.net/" target="_blank">ThemeForest</a> is by far the largest site for purchasing premium themes and markets our very own <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/2833226?ref=ThemeFusion" target="_blank">Avada</a> – which is currently the number one selling theme:</p>\n<p><a href="https://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/2833226?ref=ThemeFusion"><img src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/avada_wordpress_theme.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-427799" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/avada_wordpress_theme.jpg 700w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/avada_wordpress_theme-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></figure>\n<h2>4. If You Need Extra Functionality, There&#8217;s a Plugin For That</h2>\n<p>The basic functionality of WordPress is very good and may be just what you&#8217;re looking for, but it doesn&#8217;t cover every need and want out of the box. You may need additional functionality and in WordPress this is provided by small add-ons called plugins:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wordpress_plugins.jpg"><img src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wordpress_plugins.jpg" alt="" width="1100" height="710" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-427801" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wordpress_plugins.jpg 1100w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wordpress_plugins-300x194.jpg 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wordpress_plugins-768x496.jpg 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wordpress_plugins-1024x661.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /></a></figure>\n<p>There are thousands of plugins available for free within the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">WordPress Plugin Repository</a>, each providing different additional functionality. In some cases, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/" target="_blank">Super Cache</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">Yoast SEO</a>, free plugins found here can be practically essential.</p>\n<p>Similarly to themes, the premium plugin market is rich, with sites such as <a href="http://codecanyon.net/" target="_blank">CodeCanyon</a> offering thousands of plugins for purchase. Again, like premium themes, you&#8217;ll often find more committed development and dedicated support when compared to free options.</p>\n<h2>5. WordPress Has a Large, Strong Community</h2>\n<p>A major benefit of using WordPress is its strong, passionate, and inclusive community. The WordPress.org website has <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/" target="_blank">its own forums</a>, where users share advice and ask for help on a regular basis. If you have a question to ask, this is the place to do it! Many plugin and theme developers have support forums here for their free offerings too, so support is always at hand and you&#8217;ll more often than not, be talking directly to the developers themselves:</p>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-403041" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-forums.png" alt="The WordPress.org forums." width="633" height="326" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-forums.png 1942w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-forums-300x154.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-forums-768x395.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wordpress-forums-1024x527.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></figure>\n<p>Finally, as WordPress has grown, so has its developer base. The platform attracts contributors from all manner of other fields and industries, who pool their talents to make WordPress better. Updates to WordPress itself are frequent, with a team of hundreds releasing <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/" target="_blank">three core updates per year</a>.</p>\n<h2>6. E-Commerce Is Easy With WordPress</h2>\n<p>Unlike a hand-coded website, setting up an e-commerce solution on your WordPress website is easy when using one of a number of available plugins.</p>\n<p>One such example is <a href="https://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a> – currently the most popular e-commerce solution available and integrated with Avada. Its strengths lie in how fast it is to set up a store and its support from all major payment providers.</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woocommerce-homepage.jpg"><img src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woocommerce-homepage.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="773" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-427803" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woocommerce-homepage.jpg 1200w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woocommerce-homepage-300x193.jpg 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woocommerce-homepage-768x495.jpg 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woocommerce-homepage-1024x660.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>\n<p>You&#8217;re not restricted to just WooCommerce though. There are other solutions available, such as <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a> (specializing in digital only products), and <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-for-wordpress" target="_blank">Shopify</a> as an alternative to both.</p>\n<p>Finally, while it&#8217;s not a WordPress-specific solution, by adding an open-source SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a>, you could potentially build an online store with WordPress, Avada, WooCommerce, and Let&#8217;s Encrypt for very little outlay.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>At this point, you&#8217;re probably on-board with the idea of using WordPress as the platform for publishing your website. If you&#8217;re itching to get started, here&#8217;s what to do next:<br />\n<div class="shortcode-list">\n<ol>\n<li>Find a <a href="https://theme-fusion.com/hosting/" target="_blank">suitable web host</a> for your website that ideally offers one-click WordPress install.</li>\n<li>Look for a theme that can help you create an amazing websites with advanced options that require no coding, is constantly updated and provides 5 star customer support, such as <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/2833226?ref=ThemeFusion" target="_blank">Avada</a>.</li>\n<li>Browse the WordPress.org <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">Plugin Directory</a> to see the scope of what plugins are available for download.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Choosing a publishing platform for your website can be tough and choosing the wrong one means wasting time and money later, when migrating to a more suitable solution. WordPress should be your first choice for publishing your website. In this post we looked at some of the reasons why.

Confirmation of the patch release date can be found here under 5.1.4: goo.gl/NGU83S … and confirmation of the changelog release that lists out the security fixes can be found here: goo.gl/40T2gp</p>\n<p>This was a unique situation for us because it started with a person who reported this and showed us the post they would make live. While we appreciate being made know of security or bug issues, and fix them quickly, we had major concerns over how we were approached. </p>\n<p>A bounty reward was being pursued, the content of the post they were making live explained how to fully use the exploit itself, in addition questions asked to hide those portions of the content were asked and we answered, but were ignored. The person hid their identity, ignored our requests and even published the post early. Most shockingly is the creator of that site had a script running that automatically creates their email as an admin user for the sites it’s run on. You can view this in their comments. While the script appears to be changed, even having such a thing should give anyone caution. We had no clue who we were dealing with, but clearly this was wrong. Anyone using Avada should check their user area of WP Admin and verify you know of all users listed.</p>\n<p><strong>There are several important factors to note:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> We (ThemeFusion) do not have all customer emails. In fact, we have less than 1/5th. Envato keeps them and does not give them to the authors who sell items. While we petition to get them, it goes nowhere so sending out a public blog post before everyone was made aware (through Envato&#8217;s eBlast) would of also made potential hackers aware who would take advantage of it.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Due to the above, we have no way of contacting all of our customers at once. In addition, we had concerns over the post of the reporter which explains how to use the exploit, and not knowing when they were sending out the post, we had to rely on Envato to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Each time we send in a theme update, it lists out the changelog in detail. Both security issues were listed and their fixes approved by the Envato review team and the new version posted on the marketplace.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> We did a similar thing to what WP did back in February and elected to put off disclosing the vulnerability to make sure that our users who use automatic updates on their sites – were protected before going public.</p>\n<p>We allowed customers to see auto updates for both the theme and the patcher tool and get as many updated as possible. The patcher tool description and changelog were descriptive in making users aware that security issues were fixed. Nor is this information buried as we described above, in fact they use the standard WordPress method of letting you know updates or patches are available and ready to apply. The changelog link is directly on the updates page in WP admin, the themes page as well, and the patcher tool describes each one in it’s location in WP admin. In addition, all of this is online at our support center.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> This all being very recent, and in agreement with Envato about the security related customer notification, we expected the actual communiqué to be sent out to each person that has purchased Avada, which it has been. However we implicitly asked Envato to allow us to review the content of the email before it was sent. We wanted to review the content of the eBlast so that we can ensure our customers are being given the correct information and to include additional helpful information about the update or users who were updating from much older versions. Lastly, we asked to know exactly when it was sent out so we could time ours as well. Unfortunately Envato did not get in touch with us in time.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> The day Envato did send out the eBlast to every customer, we received it as any customer would and then also posted the information on our site: https://theme-fusion.com/knowledgebase/security-fixes-added-5-1-5/</p>\n<p>We did inform our users about the available update that included the security fix through the several ways that we could: changelog, automatic patcher tool, a user through our private Facebook group and of course the automatic theme update. None of this information is buried. Even before we released 5.1.5, the security patch fix was done in 24 hours or less through our live patcher tool. Like it is in WordPress, it can be easily seen, that a patch/update is available. Both were labeled starting with “Security fix”, containing the kind of security issue “(ex: XSS)”.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did we wait some time before a publicly available disclosure was done from our side?</strong><br />\n<em>To protect our customers.</em> </p>\n<p><strong>How can this course of action protect customers?</strong><br />\n<em>We do know from website traffic checks, that our user base does update to new versions very fast. So making the update available, and using the more private information channels listed above (auto patch notifications, auto theme updates), we made sure that the majority of our users was already protected before the general public (which of course includes potential hackers) was made aware of the security issue through public blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>This is not an uncommon approach, but also something WordPress has done, examples below:<br />\n<a href="https://threatpost.com/wordpress-silently-fixed-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-4-72-update/123533/" target="_blank">https://threatpost.com/wordpress-silently-fixed-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-4-72-update/123533/</a><br />\n<a href="http://www.securityweek.com/wordpress-delayed-disclosure-critical-vulnerability" target="_blank">http://www.securityweek.com/wordpress-delayed-disclosure-critical-vulnerability</a><br />\n<a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/2017/03/early-vulnerability-disclosure-thwarts-wordpress-hackers/" target="_blank">https://www.imperva.com/blog/2017/03/early-vulnerability-disclosure-thwarts-wordpress-hackers/</a></p>\n<p>The issue itself has been resolved over a month ago, a patch created in 24 hours or less once we were notified and our user base was informed about it (automatically) through our changelog, our live patcher tool and a post in our private Facebook group. That is as much as we can do since we do not have all customer emails. Lastly and finally, Envato sent the full eBlast to all customers last week. Time in-between users updating and a public disclosure is needed for a reason.</p>\n<p>Our customers know we are not negligent in any way, they know we do everything possible for them and this involves fixing any and all security or bug issues. We campaign tirelessly for all of our customers, to maintain their installs and ensure that the theme is always updated or a patch applied.</p>\n<p>We will keep doing what we always have done and build strong relationships with our customers through trust and communication.</p>\n<p>ThemeFusion</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://theme-fusion.com/security-fixes-added-5-1-5/">Security Fixes Added in 5.1.5</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://theme-fusion.com">Theme Fusion</a>.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"http://theme-fusion.com/security-fixes-added-5-1-5/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"8";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"Head to Head: A Comparison Between AMP and Instant Articles for WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://theme-fusion.com/comparing-amp-instant-articles-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"http://theme-fusion.com/comparing-amp-instant-articles-wordpress/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 May 2017 13:48:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Beginners Guide";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"amp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"instant articles";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"mobile speed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://theme-fusion.com/?p=401732";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:710:"<p>Web browsing on mobile devices has steadily increased from the early &#8217;00s, to the point where we&#8217;re now consuming more content from mobile devices than any other platform.

We took an in-depth look at two of them in our beginner&#8217;s guides to integrating <a href="https://theme-fusion.com/beginners-guide-integrating-amp-wordpress/" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s Accelerated Mobile Pages</a> and <a href="https://theme-fusion.com/?p=401486&amp;preview=true" target="_blank">Facebook&#8217;s Instant Articles</a> with WordPress. However, you may be unclear as to whether you need both of these solutions to enhance your visitors&#8217; mobile browsing experience.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll give a brief overview of both <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank">Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)</a> and <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com/" target="_blank">Instant Articles</a>. We&#8217;ll compare their functionality, giving our opinion on each and look at whether or not you need both solutions to improve visitors&#8217; mobile browsing experience.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>\n<h2>An Introduction to AMP and Instant Articles</h2>\n<p>On the surface, both AMP and Instant Articles have the same goal achieved through similar means; loading web pages rapidly on mobile devices through a reduction in the underlying code:</p>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401094" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp.png" alt="An example of an AMP-compatible page from the Washington Post." width="633" height="804" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp.png 1300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp-236x300.png 236w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp-768x976.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp-806x1024.png 806w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></figure>\n<p>Furthermore, Google and Facebook both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)" target="_blank">cache</a> the resulting page on their own servers, further improving speed benefits for end users. However, their underlying approaches to the task are very different.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start by looking at AMP.</p>\n<h3>Accelerated Mobile Pages</h3>\n<p>The <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank">AMP Project</a> is an open-source initiative between Google and Twitter. Like WordPress itself, AMP is open to anyone wanting to use it or contribute to the codebase. AMP eschews any additional functionality than what&#8217;s necessary to deliver blazingly fast web pages to mobile devices.</p>\n<p>To enable WordPress users to get on board, Automattic has developed the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/" target="_blank">AMP Plugin</a>, which generates AMP-compatible versions of any relevant page (found by appending <em>amp</em> to the URL). This video, from the AMP Project homepage, sums up the project as a whole:</p>\n<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WrpkFROqR0Q?feature=oembed&#038;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The AMP Plugin itself is a sparse affair. There are no settings to configure whatsoever, it&#8217;s a true &#8216;set and forget&#8217; plugin. For further styling of AMP-compatible pages, you&#8217;d need to turn to a plugin such as Yoast&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/glue-for-yoast-seo-amp/" target="_blank">Glue for Yoast SEO &amp; AMP</a>. Further integration with <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> is possible through the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">Google Analytics by MonsterInsights</a> plugin, or an alternative such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pagefrog/" target="_blank">PageFrog</a>.</p>\n<p>For an in-depth look at AMP, take a look at our article on <a href="https://theme-fusion.com/beginners-guide-integrating-amp-wordpress/" target="_blank">integrating AMP with WordPress</a>.</p>\n<h3>Instant Articles</h3>\n<p><a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com/" target="_blank">Instant Articles</a> is Facebook&#8217;s own initiative to improve mobile browsing speeds, but unlike AMP, it&#8217;s a &#8216;closed-source&#8217; proprietary solution. Instant Article-compatible pages are only viewable within the Facebook app, with users forced to work almost entirely within Facebook&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Articles are published through an RSS feed edited with HTML5 and WordPress users can enable Instant Articles through <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fb-instant-articles/" target="_blank">the Instant Articles for WP plugin</a>, which was jointly developed by Automattic and Norwegian developers <a href="https://en.dekode.no/" target="_blank">Dekode</a>. Like the AMP Plugin, this offering has no settings of its own. All options can be found within your Facebook page&#8217;s settings.</p>\n<p>In contrast to AMP&#8217;s sparse &#8216;out of the box&#8217; styling options, Facebook has provided a suite of tools to immerse the reader: video autoplaying, embedded maps and audio and the viewing of images by tilting your device are all possible with a little extra code. Furthermore, a set of styling options are provided within the Facebook Style Editor, with user engagement stats accessed through the standard page analytics.</p>\n<p>This video, from Facebook&#8217;s official <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/facebook" target="_blank">Vimeo channel</a>, explains the platform in more detail:</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/127539718?theme=none&#038;wmode=opaque" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" title="Introducing Instant Articles" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>For an in-depth look at Instant Articles, take a look at our article on <a href="https://theme-fusion.com/beginners-guide-integrating-instant-articles-wordpress" target="_blank">integrating Instant Articles with WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>With the overviews of both solutions out of the way, lets get a little deeper and compare the various aspects side by side.</p>\n<h2>Comparing AMP and Instant Articles for WordPress</h2>\n<p>It should be pretty clear by now that AMP and Instant Articles are similar solutions for improving mobile browsing speeds, but with both covering different areas of the web. That being said, there <em>are</em> differences between the two that warrant further investigation:</p>\n<h3>Openness</h3>\n<p>AMP is open-source while Facebook is closed-source, which could be important for future development. With AMP&#8217;s open-source policy, anyone is able to contribute to the codebase. If Google decided to stop development of AMP for any reason, others can step in to continue the project. As such, AMP could be an everlasting solution to mobile browsing speeds. By contrast, if Facebook decided that development of Instant Articles is no longer worthwhile, there could be thousands of adopters left high and dry without a solution that caters to Facebook users.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of Instant Articles is that social interaction is handled entirely within Facebook. This could potentially affect website hit counts and page views. The reduction in traffic could lead to negative ramifications for site owners down the line.</p>\n<h3>The Signup Process</h3>\n<p>Getting started with AMP is as simple as installing the plugin. It is the definition of set and forget and with no barriers to entry, anyone can provide AMP-compatible pages to mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Instant Articles, however, has a number of steps to follow and at times the process can be confusing:</p>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401692 size-full" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-initial-setup.png" alt="The Initial Setup page for Instant Articles." width="623" height="318" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-initial-setup.png 623w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-initial-setup-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></figure>\n<p>With Instant Articles being Facebook&#8217;s baby, they&#8217;ve raised the bar on the point of entry, each page must have a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/publishing" target="_blank">minimum of 50 posts</a> before being considered, and Facebook manually vets each feed before accepting content:</p>\n<figure><img class="size-full wp-image-401694 aligncenter" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-step-two.png" alt="The Step Two section for Instant Articles." width="575" height="262" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-step-two.png 575w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-step-two-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /></figure>\n<h3>Advertising</h3>\n<p>Due to AMP&#8217;s sparse functionality, it doesn&#8217;t yet support &#8216;<a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/325878c6bde7a4bd40d67e8c81b9e599af1039d7/ads/integration-guide.md" target="_blank">interstitials</a>&#8216; (i.e. pop-up ads) or <a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Flash</a>. This, along with having to rebuild elements such as paywalls and subscription content due to <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/spec.html" target="_blank">restrictive specifications</a>, means AMP won&#8217;t exactly appeal to those websites currently serving a high volume of ads to users.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Facebook has offered publishers the chance to sell ads through Instant Articles and keep 100% of any revenue. Whether this generous rate continues, remains to be seen. On paper at least, Instant Articles appears to be the go-to choice for those relying on ad revenue.</p>\n<h3>Search Engine Optimization Benefits</h3>\n<p>With AMP&#8217;s and Instant Articles&#8217; respective owners, it would be remiss of either not to promote compatible pages heavily on their own websites. However, Facebook has stated that Instant Article-compatible pages will see <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/faq" target="_blank">no ranking benefits within News Feeds</a>.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, Google appears to be giving preference to AMP-compatible pages, showing them at the top of search results on mobile devices:</p>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401095" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/google-search-amp.png" alt="A mock-up of Google\'s prioritization of AMP-compatible pages." width="316" height="579" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/google-search-amp.png 634w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/google-search-amp-164x300.png 164w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/google-search-amp-559x1024.png 559w" sizes="(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px" /></figure>\n<p>With Google&#8217;s search dominance, along with Facebook&#8217;s lack of promotion of Instant Articles, the perception may be that AMP has a wider reach – regardless of the underlying benefits to users.</p>\n<h3>Styling</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve already mentioned AMP&#8217;s focus on pure speed benefits over extra functionality and in order to style your AMP-compatible pages you&#8217;ll currently need extra plugins. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/glue-for-yoast-seo-amp/" target="_blank">Glue for Yoast SEO &amp; AMP</a> is the clear choice if you&#8217;ve installed <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">Yoast SEO</a>, while <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pagefrog/" target="_blank">PageFrog</a> is also a worthy alternative. Both plugins provide basic styling to text, backgrounds, and colors.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Instant Articles has placed its immersive and interactive functionality front and center, promoting it ahead of any speed benefits. Styling your articles is achieved through Facebook&#8217;s Style Editor, complete with a choice of fonts and colors and they&#8217;ve also provided a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/guides/design" target="_blank">design guide</a> to get you up and running.</p>\n<p>Now you understand more about AMP and Instant Articles and with all of the comparisons between them out of the way, you&#8217;re likely asking yourself an important question…</p>\n<h2>What Does It All Mean for Me?</h2>\n<p>In a nutshell, both AMP and Instant Articles essentially work towards the same goal, delivering fast web browsing speeds to mobile devices, but look to achieve them in different ways. However, given that Instant Articles and AMP provide benefits to different areas of the web, it makes sense to utilize both to offer your mobile visitors a snappy browsing experience.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Mobile browsing technology is being revolutionized by the likes of Facebook and Google. Due to the similarities of AMP and Instant Articles, you may be confused about which solutions you need to enhance mobile browsing speeds for your visitors.</p>\n<p>Now you have some clarity, let&#8217;s take a moment to sum up what we&#8217;ve learned and how you can harness it for your own websites:</p>\n<div class="shortcode-list">\n<ol>\n<li>AMP is a mainly Google-led approach to improving mobile browsing speeds.</li>\n<li>Instant Articles is Facebook&#8217;s proprietary solution to improving mobile page speeds.</li>\n<li>In order to offer an overall improvement to your visitors&#8217; mobile experience, you&#8217;ll need to utilize both solutions.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>There looks to be additional solutions on the horizon too, with Apple developing their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/" target="_blank">News Publisher</a> solution.

However, one major developer has been so far conspicuous by their absence, despite their <a href="http://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebooks-dominance-in-app-ecosystem-is-striking-above-alphabet/" target="_blank">overall dominance of our web time</a>.</p>\n<figure><a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com/" target="_blank">Instant Articles</a> is Facebook&#8217;s own initiative to improve mobile browsing speeds and much like the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/" target="_blank">AMP Plugin</a> for Google&#8217;s project, Automattic has stepped up to develop <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fb-instant-articles/" target="_blank">their own plugin</a> for WordPress integration.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll look at what Instant Articles is, its limitations and how to integrate it with your WordPress website. In our article on <a href="https://theme-fusion.com/beginners-guide-integrating-amp-wordpress/" target="_blank">integrating AMP with WordPress</a>, we explained some of the technical terms found here, so it&#8217;s worth reading through that first, to get up to speed.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re ready, let&#8217;s get started!</p>\n<h2>What Is Facebook’s Instant Articles?</h2>\n<p>Announced as far back as <a href="https://media.fb.com/2015/05/12/instantarticles/" target="_blank">May 2015</a>, Facebook&#8217;s Instant Articles has similar goals to both Google&#8217;s and Apple&#8217;s offerings, delivering web content quickly to mobile devices. However, while Google&#8217;s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) was designed as an &#8216;open-source&#8217; project (i.e. It enables anyone to assist with development.), Instant Articles is a &#8216;closed-source&#8217; proprietary platform. As such, content is only viewable on mobile devices within the Facebook app and using Instant Articles means working completely within Facebook&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Publishing articles happens directly from WordPress through an RSS feed edited with HTML5. Instant Articles are published at the same time as the desktop article and any changes or updates are automatically captured and pushed to your feed.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401539" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-page-1.jpg" alt="An example of an Instant Article-compatible page from the Washington Post." width="375" height="536" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-page-1.jpg 750w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-page-1-210x300.jpg 210w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-page-1-716x1024.jpg 716w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>\n<p>To actually increase content delivery speed, Instant Articles borrows the same technology used to display images and videos in the Facebook app. This, coupled with the benefits of <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Optimization/Caching" target="_blank">caching</a>, means articles may load up to ten times faster than normal.</p>\n<p>This video, from Facebook&#8217;s Vimeo channel, explains the overall project in more detail:</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/127539718?theme=none&#038;wmode=opaque" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" title="Introducing Instant Articles" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>While AMP focuses on speed at the expense of extra functionality, Facebook has given content producers a number of tools to make articles immersive and interactive:</p>\n<div class="shortcode-list">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Video autoplaying:</strong> Videos will play automatically as you scroll through the article.</li>\n<li><strong>Image immersion:</strong> Readers can zoom into high-resolution images. Tilting your device enables you to explore the full-width of images, doing away with finger swipes.</li>\n<li><strong>Interactive maps:</strong> Locations mentioned throughout an article can be displayed on an interactive world map.</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded audio:</strong> Snippets of audio can be played alongside any content to provide more context to the article.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>News Feed article previews can be customized to match brand identity and can even include video. Of course, with this being Facebook, user engagement can be tracked through your page&#8217;s normal analytics screen.</p>\n<p>While all of these features are impressive, you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking that this extra functionality could impact page speeds. As alluded to earlier though (and much like Google itself), Facebook will cache all compatible Instant Articles on their servers, keeping the load time to a minimum.</p>\n<p>Finally, there looks to be more good news for content providers, publishers selling adverts through Instant Articles get to keep all revenue generated. For those extending their campaigns outside of Facebook, there&#8217;s still the option to take advantage of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-network" target="_blank">Facebook Audience Network</a>, though that appears to follow the same guidelines it always has.</p>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ve looked at what Instant Articles is, lets look at some of the format&#8217;s limitations.</p>\n<h2>What Are the Limitations of Instant Articles?</h2>\n<p>While speed and the immersion tools are big benefits, Instant Articles comes with a number of limitations to consider:</p>\n<h3>1. Eligibility</h3>\n<p>Websites with <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/publishing" target="_blank">less than 50 eligible posts</a> will be rejected outright. If your site <em>does</em> meet this post count, your site joins the queue to be manually reviewed. As with any manual process, wading through the inevitable applications takes time, and it could be that your competitors are taking advantage of Instant Articles before you.</p>\n<h3>2. Compatibility</h3>\n<p>Publishers will need multiple solutions to show the same page via the different platforms and those solutions may not be consistent in their implementation, nor play nicely with each other. Furthermore, some of the immersion tools mentioned above will need to be coded into your pages and as far as WordPress is concerned, some plugins may also need more code to be compatible.</p>\n<h3>3. User Interaction</h3>\n<p>In an <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/faq" target="_blank">FAQ on their developer website</a>, Facebook stated there will be no News Feed ranking benefit to Instant Articles; and because all interactions (such as reactions, comments, and shares) take place with the Facebook app, overall this could mean your Facebook user engagement rises, but your reach may not – leaving your original website article languishing from a lack of user interaction.</p>\n<h3>4. Future Decisions</h3>\n<p>While Facebook&#8217;s terms (such as the aforementioned 100% ad revenue) are favorable for publishers right now, if Instant Articles has a large adoption rate, these terms may change. After all, providing a tempting sign-up offer to only lock users into a lesser deal later is not a new business move. To which, Facebook may choose to remove competitor&#8217;s ads (such as Google AdSense), replacing them with their own versions and further locking in content providers.</p>\n<h3>5. Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;Walled Garden&#8217;</h3>\n<p>Finally (if you haven&#8217;t guessed by now), most aspects of Instant Articles are handled entirely within the Facebook ecosystem. The relative merits of a &#8216;walled garden&#8217; approach are beyond the scope of this article, but it may be worth considering if you enjoy the freedom of using non-proprietary solutions.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve discovered what Instant Articles is and looked at some of its limitations, let&#8217;s look at the final step: WordPress integration.</p>\n<h2>How Can I Integrate Instant Articles With My WordPress Website?</h2>\n<p>To get your WordPress website integrated with Instant Articles, you&#8217;ll need at least two things:</p>\n<div class="shortcode-list">\n<ol>\n<li>A Facebook Page that you&#8217;re the administrator for.</li>\n<li>A WordPress plugin to generate the required RSS feeds.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>While you probably have the first one, it&#8217;s the plugin, which is a a joint effort between Automattic and Norwegian developers <a href="https://en.dekode.no/" target="_blank">Dekode</a>, called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fb-instant-articles/" target="_blank">Instant Articles for WP</a>, that you may not have. Let&#8217;s take a look!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fb-instant-articles/" target="_blank">Instant Articles for WP</a></h3>\n<p><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-plugin.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401543" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-plugin.png" alt="The Instant Articles for WP plugin." width="633" height="144" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-plugin.png 1590w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-plugin-300x68.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-plugin-768x175.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-plugin-1024x233.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>Much like Automattic&#8217;s AMP plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fb-instant-articles/" target="_blank">Instant Articles for WP</a> provides no settings to tweak. All of the magic happens elsewhere. Once installed, a new RSS feed is created, which you can see by appending either <em>/?feed=instant-articles</em> or <em>/feed/instant-articles</em> (depending on your permalink settings) to your website&#8217;s URL:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rss-feed-url-one.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401527" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rss-feed-url-one.png" alt="A navbar showing one style of RSS feed generated by Facebook\'s Instant Articles" width="360" height="33" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rss-feed-url-one.png 720w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rss-feed-url-one-300x28.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a></figure>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rss-feed-url-two.pn"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401534" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rss-feed-url-two.png" alt="A navbar showing another style of RSS feed generated by Facebook\'s Instant Articles" width="360" height="33" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rss-feed-url-two.png 720w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rss-feed-url-two-300x28.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a></figure>\n<p>For the rest of the process, you&#8217;ll need to sign up to <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com" target="_blank">Instant Articles</a> – enable your page on the next screen – then log into your Facebook Page, navigate to the <em>Settings</em> screen, and select <em>Instant Articles</em> from the left hand menu:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook-settings-tab-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426870" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook-settings-tab-1.jpg" alt="facebook-settings-tab-1" width="194" height="173" /></a></figure>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-menu-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426873" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-menu-2.jpg" alt="instant-articles-menu-2" width="294" height="200" /></a></figure>\n<p>The setup process has a number of steps, but you can skip most of the <em>Initial Setup</em> section if you want to get up and running straight away:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-initial-setup.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-401692 aligncenter" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-initial-setup.png" alt="The Initial Setup page for Instant Articles." width="623" height="318" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-initial-setup.png 623w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/instant-articles-initial-setup-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></a></figure>\n<p><em>Step 2</em> involves actually submitting your articles, but this won&#8217;t be possible until you&#8217;ve connected your RSS feeds.

Developers have been slowly coming on board, with Automattic in particular developing the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/" target="_blank">AMP Plugin</a>, which integrates this new approach to mobile design with WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will look at what the AMP project is, along with Automattic&#8217;s AMP plugin which was developed to implement AMP on WordPress. We&#8217;ll also give you some advice on how you can customize AMP for your WordPress website.</span></p>\n<h2>What Is Accelerated Mobile Pages?</h2>\n<p>The <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank">AMP Project</a> itself is (like WordPress) an open-source initiative created by Google and Twitter to collectively improve the smartphone and tablet viewing experience for everyone. The open-source platform was chosen as a direct response to &#8216;closed-source&#8217; initiatives, such as <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com/" target="_blank">Facebook&#8217;s Instant Articles</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/" target="_blank">Apple News Publisher</a>. This video from the AMP Project website explains the initiative in more detail:</p>\n<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WrpkFROqR0Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The technology behind Accelerated Mobile Pages, on the surfacef at least, is simple: it strips your website&#8217;s pages of any superfluous styling and code before storing it on a separate server, ending with a page that loads quickly and is optimized for mobile devices. Think of it as HTML on Weight Watchers:</p>\n<div id="attachment_401094" style="width: 643px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-401094" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp-806x1024.png" alt="An example of an AMP-compatible page from the Washington Post." width="633" height="804" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp-806x1024.png 806w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp-236x300.png 236w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp-768x976.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/washington-post-amp.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pages will look sparser, yet no less identifiable – as this example page from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> shows.</p></div>\n<p><em>Pages will look sparser, yet no less identifiable – as this example page from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> shows.</em></p>\n<p>Getting a little deeper, AMP pages are essentially like any other HTML webpage, but with some restrictions governed by the <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/spec.html" target="_blank">AMP HTML specification</a> – some key ones being:</p>\n<div class="shortcode-list">\n<ul>\n<li>Disabling inline CSS, and streamlining the code found in preexisitng stylesheets.</li>\n<li>Other than a standardized, off-the-shelf library for functionality such as &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading" target="_blank">lazy loading</a>&#8216;, no other JavaScript is allowed.</li>\n<li>Banning certain HTML tags outright – such as those used for forms – and substituting others (such as image and video tags) with their own <em>AMP Components </em>tags.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Of course, with a name like Accelerated Mobile Pages, you would expect speed to be the main benefit. For end users, quicker loading times means less time spent waiting and more time reading. However, for those that create and publish content, the potential for content to appear everywhere quickly is exciting. Money talks, and as <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/" target="_blank">past studies have shown</a>, a page that loads quickly means higher conversion rates and sales.</p>\n<p>Further speed gains are achieved through &#8216;caching&#8217;. Caching is the saving of already loaded webpages and storing them on a server for later viewing. This saves time by skipping the <em>server processing</em> stage of the page load. AMP was designed specifically with caching in mind. Google is providing the technology to <a href="https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/" target="_blank">cache all AMP pages on their servers</a>, further increasing browsing speed for end users.</p>\n<div id="attachment_401093" style="width: 643px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-401093" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/moz-whiteboard-caching-1024x855.jpg" alt="A diagram of the AMP caching process, explained by Moz.

If their websites don&#8217;t currently run on WordPress, they have plenty of work to do. Paywalls, advertisements, and subscription content will have to be rebuilt due to the JavaScript restrictions, and AMP <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/325878c6bde7a4bd40d67e8c81b9e599af1039d7/ads/integration-guide.md" target="_blank">doesn&#8217;t yet cater for &#8216;interstitials&#8217;</a>, (pop-up ads to you and me), or perennial early &#8217;00 technology <a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Flash</a>.</p>\n<p>With this being a Google initiative, content providers may have an added incentive to get on board with AMP sooner rather than later. It may just be that Google shows a preference to AMP activated pages in the future. In a <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank">demo on the project website</a>, AMP activated pages are shown at the very top of the search results. So it pays for content creators and providers to put in the leg work to be ready now.</p>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401095" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/google-search-amp-559x1024.png" alt="A mock-up of Google\'s prioritization of AMP-compatible pages." width="279" height="511" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/google-search-amp-559x1024.png 559w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/google-search-amp-164x300.png 164w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/google-search-amp.png 634w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /></figure>\n<p>Given the rapid development of AMP, it hasn&#8217;t taken long for developers such as Automattic (among others) to jump on the bandwagon and find a way of making AMP accessible to all WordPress users – their solution coming in the form of the aptly titled <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/" target="_blank">AMP Plugin</a>.</p>\n<h2>What Does the AMP Plugin Do?</h2>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401013" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-plugin-screen-1024x335.png" alt="Automattic\'s AMP Plugin screen." width="633" height="207" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-plugin-screen-1024x335.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-plugin-screen-300x98.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-plugin-screen-768x251.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-plugin-screen.png 1436w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></figure>\n<p>Of course, having a technology that enables users to view your website on their device in milliseconds is all for nothing if you can&#8217;t generate the required pages. That&#8217;s where the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/" target="_blank">AMP Plugin</a> comes in. At this point, we would typically walk you through the plugin settings screen and look at setting it up for your needs. However, given the streamlined nature of AMP, the plugin has no options screen to navigate. It is true set and forget.</p>\n<p>Once active, the plugin dynamically generates AMP-compatible versions of your webpages, so there&#8217;s no extra effort on your part. These pages can be viewed by appending <em>amp</em> to the relevant URL:</p>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401040" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-url.png" alt="A screenshot of a URL, appended with /amp." width="442" height="30" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-url.png 984w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-url-300x20.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-url-768x52.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amp-url-960x66.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /></figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that the AMP plugin doesn&#8217;t automatically display your AMP content. It only generates the necessary compatible pages and the responsibility for displaying them lies in the hands of Google Search <em>et al.</em></p>\n<p>Also, the rapid rate of AMP development, coupled with Automattic&#8217;s desire to get WordPress users ready before the launch date, means that the plugin hasn&#8217;t yet reached a full version point.

However, there are some areas you may want to delve deeper into and they&#8217;re only accessible through other plugins.</p>\n<p>As we explained earlier, stylesheets are heavily streamlined, after all, it&#8217;s one of the major components in delivering rapid page speeds and other than your site logo, you won&#8217;t see very much in the way of styling.  Furthermore, if you&#8217;re one of the one million plus users who have installed <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">Yoast SEO</a>, the metadata used by the AMP Plugin may not be the most optimal. Details on how it differs is sketchy at best, but fortunately, Yoast has developed a plugin to kill two birds with one stone: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/glue-for-yoast-seo-amp/" target="_blank">Glue for Yoast SEO &amp; AMP</a>.</p>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401025" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/glue-plugin-1024x340.png" alt="The Glue for Yoast SEO &amp; AMP lugin" width="633" height="210" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/glue-plugin-1024x340.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/glue-plugin-300x100.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/glue-plugin-768x255.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/glue-plugin.png 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></figure>\n<p>Once installed, the Glue settings can be found in the SEO dashboard admin panel…</p>\n<figure><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401027" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dashboard-glue-menu.png" alt="The dashboard menu, showing where to find the Glue plugin settings." width="310" height="249" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dashboard-glue-menu.png 620w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dashboard-glue-menu-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></figure>\n<p>…and within the settings themselves are the three tabs you&#8217;ll need to make further tweaks to your AMP pages:</p>\n<div class="shortcode-list">\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>Post types: </em></strong>While you&#8217;d generally want to see only your news and blog posts as AMP-optimized pages, Glue lets you make any relevant post type AMP-compatible.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Design: </em></strong>This tab enables you to make basic design alterations to your AMP-compatible pages. You can change the color of text and links, add a default image in the place of a missing featured image and add in extra CSS if you require.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Analytics:</strong> </em>This tab lets you add a <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> tracking code – though you&#8217;ll need further functionality provided by either the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">Google Analytics by MonsterInsights</a> plugin, or an alternative such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pagefrog/" target="_blank">PageFrog</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>You can find out more about why some of these settings are important, along with Yoast founder Joost de Valk&#8217;s opinion on AMP, in this article on the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress-amp-part-ii/" target="_blank">Yoast website</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>While the majority of us now access digital content from our smartphones and tablets. The technology used to deliver webpages to our devices has been lacking and our experience has suffered. Google is looking to set that right with Accelerated Mobile Pages – a way of marrying a mobile-first approach with the speed we now require in surfing the web.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, AMP is a technology that delivers super-speedy webpages to a user&#8217;s smartphone or tablet. To get your WordPress website ready, consider the following:</p>\n<div class="shortcode-list">\n<ol>\n<li>Install the AMP Plugin from Automattic. There are no settings to browse through, so once installed, consider yourself ready!</li>\n<li>If further styling, metatag optimization, or analytics support is important to you, consider installing both Glue and Google Analytics by MonsterInsights, or alternatively, the PageFrog plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the AMP initiative we’re on the cusp of a mobile revolution and there are more developments in the pipeline. These coming from the likes of Apple News and Facebook’s Instant Articles (in the case of Instant Articles, we&#8217;ll look at in a future post).</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How important is having a mobile-optimized site to you or your business and where will AMP fit in?

There are a number of options here to tinker with, but the main ones we need are <em>Countdown Timer End</em> (Where you add the event date.), <em>Heading Text</em> and <em>Subheading Text:</em></p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-end-date.png"><img src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-end-date.png" alt="countdown-end-date" width="1066" height="166" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426250" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-end-date.png 1066w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-end-date-300x47.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-end-date-768x120.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-end-date-1024x159.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1066px) 100vw, 1066px" /></a></figure>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-timer-text.png"><img src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-timer-text.png" alt="countdown-timer-text" width="1066" height="243" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426251" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-timer-text.png 1066w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-timer-text-300x68.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-timer-text-768x175.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-timer-text-1024x233.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1066px) 100vw, 1066px" /></a></figure>\n<p>There are further options for adding a link to the event in question, but you&#8217;re not limited to purely on-site events. For example, if you&#8217;re hosting an event on behalf of another community group with their own website, you may want to direct members there instead:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-element-link-settings.png"><img src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-element-link-settings.png" alt="countdown-element-link-settings" width="1059" height="235" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426253" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-element-link-settings.png 1059w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-element-link-settings-300x67.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-element-link-settings-768x170.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/countdown-element-link-settings-1024x227.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1059px) 100vw, 1059px" /></a></figure>\n<p>Finally, the <em>Countdown</em> element has a myriad of style options, as well as <em>CSS Class</em> and <em>ID</em> sections to add custom CSS styling if desired.</p>\n<h2>3. Launch a Community Forum</h2>\n<p>Forums have been around almost as long as the internet itself; that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re invaluable for creating an online community. You and your members can use this to discuss recent events, sermons, or even personal topics relevant to your members. With the design integrated <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/" target="_blank">bbPress plugin</a>, Avada enables you to launch a vibrant and active forum on your site.</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/forum-screenshot-1024x626.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400636" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/forum-screenshot-1024x626.png" alt="A forum page created with the bbPress plugin." width="633" height="387" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/forum-screenshot-1024x626.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/forum-screenshot-300x183.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/forum-screenshot-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>The option to create a new forum can be found in your WP Admin sidebar under the <em>Forums</em> tab:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/new-forum-tab.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400614" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/new-forum-tab.png" alt="The dashboard tab for creating a new forum." width="325" height="107" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/new-forum-tab.png 650w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/new-forum-tab-300x99.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></a></figure>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re in the <em>Create New Forum</em> screen, give your forum a title and look to the <em>Forum Attributes</em> box:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/forum-attributes.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400613" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/forum-attributes.png" alt="The Forum Attributes meta box" width="302" height="319" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/forum-attributes.png 604w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/forum-attributes-284x300.png 284w" sizes="(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /></a></figure>\n<p>Here you can choose whether to create a forum or a category, set its status as <em>Open</em> or <em>Closed</em> and determine its visibility choosing from <em>Public</em>, <em>Private</em>, or <em>Hidden</em>. For creating sub-forums, you can also specify which parent forum it belongs to.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <em>Topics</em> and <em>Replies</em> tabs within the dashboard enables you to carry out basic moderation of member activity. Topics can be set to &#8216;sticky&#8217; from here. Also, topics along with replies can be edited, trashed, or marked as spam:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/topics-screen-1024x224.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400615" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/topics-screen-1024x224.png" alt="An entry on the Topics screen." width="633" height="138" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/topics-screen-1024x224.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/topics-screen-300x66.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/topics-screen-768x168.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<h2>4. Publish Video and Audio Sermons</h2>\n<p>With the convenience of the internet, members unable to attend church no longer have to worry about the sermons they&#8217;ve missed. Those who did attend can listen again or share their favorite sermons when you archive them on your church website:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sermon-video-page-1024x313.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400617" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sermon-video-page-1024x313.png" alt="A sermon displayed on the Sermons page." width="633" height="193" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sermon-video-page-1024x313.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sermon-video-page-300x92.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sermon-video-page-768x235.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>First of all, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that you&#8217;ll need to upload your sermons to your favorite video site. That&#8217;s likely either <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407" target="_blank">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/upload" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>. Once that&#8217;s done, Avada&#8217;s Fusion Builder provides elements to embed both YouTube and Vimeo content on your site. There is also a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> element for embedding audio sermons. And just like the Countdown Timer, adding the media embed elements is very simple. Just click the <em>&#8220;+ Element&#8221;</em> button in the column you want your embed to be in and a modal window with available elements will open:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/adding-media-elements.jpg"><img src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/adding-media-elements.jpg" alt="The Fusion Builder highlighting the different embedding options." width="633" height="477" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426023" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/adding-media-elements.jpg 633w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/adding-media-elements-300x226.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>Clicking your desired element will open the options screen for that element. The important option we need is the <em>Video ID</em> or <em>Soundcloud URL</em> depending on your media source. If you&#8217;re using Vimeo, it will look like the below example. You can get the video ID by navigating to that video on the site:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-browser1-1024x212.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400620" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-browser1-1024x212.png" alt="The URL bar highlighting the video ID needed to embed content with Avada." width="633" height="131" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-browser1-1024x212.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-browser1-300x62.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-browser1-768x159.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-browser1.png 1064w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>…then copy and paste the string of numbers at the end of the URL into the <em>Video ID</em> box:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-option-1024x107.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400619" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-option-1024x107.png" alt="The Vimeo embedding element\'s Video ID text box" width="633" height="66" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-option-1024x107.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-option-300x31.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-id-option-768x80.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s that simple! Now, let&#8217;s take things even further by creating a gallery showcasing your most recent sermons:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/recent-works-1024x457.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400621" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/recent-works-1024x457.png" alt="The Sermons page showing the Recent Sermons gallery." width="633" height="283" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/recent-works-1024x457.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/recent-works-300x134.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/recent-works-768x343.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>This is a little more complex, but by the end you&#8217;ll be able to create what you see above. For this, we&#8217;ll need to navigate to the <em>Portfolio</em> tab on the dashboard and click <em>Add New</em>:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/portfolio-tab.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400625" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/portfolio-tab.png" alt="The Portfolio dashboard tab." width="326" height="157" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/portfolio-tab.png 652w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/portfolio-tab-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" /></a></figure>\n<p>This will take you to what looks like a normal WordPress post editor. You can title the sermon and add a description of the message to the post content area. That takes place in the top area of the post editor. Now, scroll down to Fusion Page Options. In these options under the <em>Portfolio</em> tab, you&#8217;ll find the <em>Video Embed Code</em> textarea:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-fusion-options-embed-code.jpg"><img src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-fusion-options-embed-code.jpg" alt="The Fusion Page Options Embed Code Field" width="633" height="781" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426029" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-fusion-options-embed-code.jpg 633w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-fusion-options-embed-code-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need something to put in here so Avada knows which video you want to embed. For that, we head to the video on our chosen hosting site as we did before. This time we click on the paper airplane icon to the right of the video:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vimeo-share-icon-1024x396.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400629" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vimeo-share-icon-1024x396.png" alt="A Vimeo video, with a highlighted Share icon." width="633" height="245" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vimeo-share-icon-1024x396.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vimeo-share-icon-300x116.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vimeo-share-icon-768x297.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>A pop-up box will appear with the code you need. You can click on the text in the <em>Embed</em> section and it will expand and auto select the code you need. Right-click on the selection and copy the text. It will look something like the below image:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/share-box-embed-code-1024x869.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400627" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/share-box-embed-code-1024x869.png" alt="The Vimeo Share box, with highlighted Embed code." width="544" height="461" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/share-box-embed-code-1024x869.png 1024w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/share-box-embed-code-300x254.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/share-box-embed-code-768x652.png 768w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/share-box-embed-code.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /></a></figure>\n<p>Head back to the <em>Video Embed Code</em> textarea in the <em>Fusion Page Options</em>. Now paste your code here. <strong>Special Note</strong>: There will be some additional HTML that you don&#8217;t need in this field. You can safely delete anything from <em>&lt;p&gt; </em>onwards:</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/delete-embed-code.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-400624" src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/delete-embed-code.png" alt="The Video Code Embed screen, with highlighted, text to delete." width="474" height="214" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/delete-embed-code.png 948w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/delete-embed-code-300x135.png 300w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/delete-embed-code-768x347.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></a></figure>\n<p>Click <em>Update </em>at the top of the post editor and continue to add new entries in the <em>Portfolio</em> tab. Now we need to display them on your page. To do this, head to the <em>Pages</em> dashboard tab and find the page you&#8217;d like to display your sermons on. You&#8217;ll need to add the <em>Portfolio Element</em> to the page using the same method as the above element additions.</p>\n<figure><a href="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-element.jpg"><img src="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-element.jpg" alt="Portfolio Element in the builder." width="633" height="310" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426036" srcset="https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-element.jpg 633w, https://theme-fusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-element-300x147.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></figure>\n<p>As with previous elements, clicking on them in the element list will open their settings in a window. Configure as needed and click <em>&#8220;Save&#8221;</em> to add the element to the page. There are various layout options which you can experiment with to find a layout you like.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A website that doesn&#8217;t engage with its visitors can mean that the important events and community activities you have planned go unnoticed by your congregation.

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8BDWH3QG-1-video" width="632" height="342" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world?

These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

A work released under CC0 is dedicated to the public domain to the fullest extent permitted by law. If that is not possible for any reason, CC0 also provides a lax, permissive license as a fallback. Both public domain works and the lax license provided by CC0 are compatible with the GNU GPL.</p>\n<p>If you want to release your work to the public domain, we recommend you use CC0.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unsplash&#8217;s new license states (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote><p>All photos published on Unsplash can be used for free. You can use them for commercial and noncommercial purposes. You do not need to ask permission from or provide credit to the photographer or Unsplash, although it is appreciated when possible.</p>\n<p>More precisely, Unsplash grants you a nonexclusive copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from Unsplash for free, including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the photographer or Unsplash. <strong>This license does not include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The inability to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service is a restriction on how the photos can be used, calling into question its compatibility with the GPL.</p>\n<p>Luke Chesser, co-founder of Unsplash, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukechesser/status/873146783945416704">explained on</a> Twitter that individual photos are still CC0-licensed and therefor GPL compatible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Unsplash license doesn&#8217;t violate GPL and can still be used in WordPress themes,&#8221; Chesser said. &#8220;There are no restrictions on the individual photos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is only a restriction on the collection of photos, which doesn&#8217;t even apply unless your intent is to create a similar service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, it&#8217;s ok if someone creates a site that displays the best photos of bridges from Unsplash. But if the site makes those photos available for download, it would <a href="https://community.unsplash.com/help-section/do-i-have-to-give-credit-to-a-photographer-when-i-use-their-photo">violate the license</a>.</p>\n<p>On its FAQ page, Unsplash <a href="https://community.unsplash.com/help-section/what-is-the-unsplash-license-and-where-can-i-find-it">explains why</a> the restriction was put in place:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The fuel that drives Unsplash is the exceptional images that are generously contributed by people from all over the world. Without them, none of this would work. Unsplash would be nothing. We owe everyone who’s contributed a photo not only a thank you but support and empowerment for the gifts they’ve given us.</p>\n<p>Out of respect for our contributors and our ability to uphold our value of empowering creativity, we added this sentence to the Unsplash License.</p>\n<p>We don’t support the mass duplication of Unsplash photos with the purpose of replicating a similar or competing service because it leads to confusion which negatively impacts both the spirit of open creative use and the celebration of Unsplash contributors.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mass compiling of photos from Unsplash to distribute on other sites has created legal issues in the past. &#8220;Sites that mass duplicate and compile Unsplash photos point support and legal issues back to Unsplash, while continuing to redistribute photos that may be removed on Unsplash,&#8221; the company said.</p>\n<p>The reasons cited by Unsplash for putting the restriction in place are some of the same reasons WordPress plugin developers <a href="https://wptavern.com/the-gpl-license-doesnt-provide-the-freedom-to-infringe-registered-trademarks">register trademarks</a>. The GPL allows the following freedoms.</p>\n<ol start="0">\n<li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>\n<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.</li>\n<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>\n<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Over the years, there have been many instances in the WordPress community where businesses have taken advantage of these freedoms merely to profit from the work of others.</p>\n<p>The reselling of commercial plugins causes confusion in the market and resellers typically point support and other inquiries back to the plugin&#8217;s developers.</p>\n<p>Trademarks give commercial plugin authors measures to protect their brand without violating the GPL. A good example is the <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/trademark/">GravityForms Trademark page</a> which clearly outlines how its brand can be used and displayed.</p>\n<p>For now, it appears that most people who use Unsplash will be unaffected by the licensing change. However, as long as there is one license that governs the use of images and it has at least one restriction, its compatibility with the GPL will remain in doubt.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 09 Jun 2017 21:27:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:131:"WPTavern: Major Update Coming to WP Super Cache: New REST API, User-Friendly Settings Page, and Improvements to Legacy File Storage";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71718";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:139:"https://wptavern.com/major-update-coming-to-wp-super-cache-new-rest-api-user-friendly-settings-page-and-improvements-to-legacy-file-storage";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2550:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-super-cache.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/" target="_blank">WP Super Cache</a>, a WordPress caching plugin maintained by Donncha Ó Caoimh and Automattic, is looking for users to help test the plugin <a href="https://odd.blog/2017/06/07/take-a-sneak-peek-at-wp-super-cache/" target="_blank">ahead of the next major update</a>. Ó Caoimh said the upcoming release is in a &#8220;stable and usable&#8221; state, but with the unusually large number of bug fixes and new features, it could use some testing in different environments.</p>\n<p>WP Super Cache is set to introduce a REST API, which will be useful for situations where administrators are not using wp-admin to manage their sites. The plugin is also <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/177" target="_blank">changing the location for storing legacy cache files</a> to the supercache directory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This makes it easier to manage these files,&#8221; Ó Caoimh said. &#8220;The plugin doesn’t have to search through potentially hundreds of cache files for those that need to be deleted if a page updates or someone leaves a comment. Now all those files will be in the same directory structure the anonymous “supercache” files will be. I’m really excited about this feature as it makes caching for logged-in users/users who comment and caching of pages with parameters so much faster now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ó Caoimh is also updating the settings page to make it easier for new users to understand the options. Currently it asks the user to select from mod_rewrite, PHP, or Legacy page caching with little explanation for why a user might opt for a certain delivery method.

The city was one of three selected to be part of the <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-incubator-program-to-launch-in-indonesia-zimbabwe-and-columbia" target="_blank">WordCamp Incubator Program</a> in 2016. Harare&#8217;s first WordCamp was successful in connecting the local WordPress community and inspiring local leaders to carry on with organizing future events.</p>\n<p>Last year the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Harare-WordPress-Meetup/" target="_blank">Harare WordPress Meetup</a> had 82 members and the group has nearly doubled in size with 142 members today.  Members meet every month and communicate outside of meetings via an active WhatsApp group. The current venue they use was donated by <a href="http://motorepublik.co/" target="_blank">Moto Republik</a>, thanks to one of the members Munya Bloggo, who works there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was always the goal of the WordCamp Incubator program to organize an easily-reproducible event that we could organize independently in the years to come,&#8221; 2017 lead organizer <a href="https://franksweb.org/" target="_blank">Thabo Tswana</a> said. &#8220;We expected it of ourselves. Some attendees and organizers actually approached me about the next WordCamp during WordCamp Harare 2016.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tswana said the turnout at last year&#8217;s event was larger than he expected, because very few attendees booked tickets online. The majority ended up buying tickets at the door on the day of the event, a fairly uncommon scenario for most WordCamps that makes it somewhat difficult to estimate total attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the biggest impacts that WordCamp had was introducing us to the WordPress Community,&#8221; Tswana said. &#8220;There are so many WordPress users in Zimbabwe (bloggers, designers, developers) but hardly anyone knew about the WordPress Community or how to contribute to WordPress. We now have a growing meetup group and the local community is starting to become more aware of what WordPress has to offer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The local community consists primarily of developers and advanced WordPress users and Tswana said he would like see more of them getting involved with contributing. As the majority of meetup members are new to the larger WordPress community, they are still learning about the many ways users can contribute back to the project.</p>\n<p>Two Harare WordPress Meetup members, Kudakwashe Zafevere and Rima Trew, arranged for Hellenic Academy to donate a venue for WordCamp Harare 2017. The facilities are well-suited to hosting a tech event with wifi available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This year, some local companies and organizations expressed interest in helping us out,&#8221; Tswana said. &#8220;We definitely expect more attendees due to the buzz that was created by last year&#8217;s WordCamp. To sum it all up, more people and organizations are getting involved this year.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 09 Jun 2017 02:33:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:118:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8 “Evans” Released Featuring Nearby WordPress Events, New Media Widgets, and Link Boundaries";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71534";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:121:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-evans-released-featuring-nearby-wordpress-events-new-media-widgets-and-link-boundaries";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7169:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">WordPress 4.8 &#8220;Evans&#8221;</a> is available for download and is the first major release of the year under the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">new release cycle</a>. WordPress 4.8 is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans">William John &#8220;Bill&#8221; Evans</a>, an American jazz pianist.</p>\n<h2>New Image, Video, and Audio Widgets</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 includes <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">three new widgets</a>. All three widgets make it easier to display images, video, or audio  without using HTML. The Text widget now has support for TinyMCE providing rich-text functionality. Similar to the post editor, users have a choice between using a Visual or Text editor with limited formatting options.</p>\n<img />Image, Video, and Enhanced Text Widget\n<p>Because the Text widget uses TinyMCE, it inherits its nuances when it comes to pasting and displaying code. In a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">dev note</a> that explains how TinyMCE was added to the Text Widget, Weston Ruter offers the following notice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When pasting HTML into the &#8216;Text&#8217; (HTML) tab of the Text widget, any extraneous line breaks should be removed or else unwanted paragraphs and line beaks may result. This is particularly important when you paste in <code>script</code> or <code>style</code> tags (as in the case of 3rd-party JavaScript embeds), since auto-inserted paragraphs will cause script errors; this will be fixed in <span class="p2_hovercardify"><a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2833">#2833</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This behavior aligns with longstanding behavior in the post editor, so it is not new, although it does differ from how the Text widget has previously behaved. As noted above, for previously existing Text widgets that had the auto-add paragraphs&#8217; checkbox unchecked (and thus the <code>filter</code> instance prop set to <code>false</code>), the previous behavior of not doing <code>wpautop</code> will be maintained: only once the widgets are modified will any extraneous line breaks need to be removed.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Link Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Adding and editing links in the visual editor is more intuitive thanks to link boundaries. Link boundaries provide a visual representation of where a link begins and ends. This helps prevent adding unnecessary text to the beginning or end of a link.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>See Nearby WordPress Events in the Dashboard</h2>\n<p>One of the pillars of WordPress&#8217; ecosystem is its community of meetups and WordCamps. <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">In 2016</a>, more than 62,566 people attended a local meetup in 58 countries. About a third of those were new members.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 draws attention to these events by <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/03/23/showing-upcoming-local-events-in-wp-admin/">enhancing the News Dashboard widget</a>. The widget will try to automatically guess your location and display meetups and WordCamps that are nearby.</p>\n<img />News Widget Shows Upcoming Meetups and WordCamps\n<p>If the location is incorrect, clicking the Pencil button opens a box where you can type in your city. The bottom of the widget includes links to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups-landing-page">WordPress Meetup landing page</a>, <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/">WordCamp Central Schedule</a>, and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/">WordPress.org news blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>Responsive Customizer Sidebar</h2>\n<p>In previous versions of WordPress, the Customizer Sidebar had a maximum width of 300 pixels. In WordPress 4.8, the <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-increases-maximum-width-of-the-customizer-sidebar-to-600-pixels">Customizer Sidebar is responsive</a> and its width will automatically increase based on the size of the screen up to a maximum of 600 pixels.</p>\n<img />Customizer Sidebar 345 Pixels Wide\n<h2>More Accessible Admin Pages</h2>\n<p>The headers on admin screens are now <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-improves-accessibility-on-admin-screens">separate elements</a> making it easier for assistive technologies to help people navigate pages.</p>\n<h2>Support Dropped for Internet Explorer Versions 8, 9, and 10</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/23/target-browser-coverage/">drops support</a> for Internet Explorer versions 8, 9, and 10 as these versions no longer receive security updates and are used by a small percentage of people. WordPress 4.8 will work in these browsers but some features related to TinyMCE will be limited. New features will no longer be tested against these older versions of IE.</p>\n<h2>Noteworthy Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/20/editor-api-changes-in-4-8/">Changes to the Editor API</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/">Embeds of WMV and WMA files are no longer supported</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">New Capabilities and others enhancements for WordPress Multisite</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/tag-cloud-widget-changes-in-4-8/">Accessibility improvements to the Tag Cloud widget</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">The addition of a Media Widgets API</a></li>\n<li>TinyMCE was updated from version <strong>4.5.6</strong> to version <strong>4.6.2</strong></li>\n<li>Twemoji was updated from version <strong>2.2.2</strong> to version <strong>2.3.0</strong></li>\n<li>zxcvbn was updated from version <strong>1.0</strong> to version <strong>4.4.1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog/">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>. 346 people contributed to WordPress 4.8 and 106 of them were first time contributors.</p>\n<p>If you think you&#8217;ve discovered a bug in WordPress 4.8, read <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/read-this-first-wordpress-4-8-master-list/">this support thread</a> first to see if it&#8217;s a common issue that&#8217;s already been reported.

Currently the app needs to be connected to the internet, but the company is working on supporting an offline mode in the next version, which is rolling out soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We used our online platform to turn a WordPress blog (<a href="https://paris.worona.org" target="_blank">paris.worona.org</a>) into a native app,&#8221; Reyes Martínez, Worona&#8217;s marketing and communications specialist, said. &#8220;We use React and fetch the content using the WP-API. The apps are created with <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is a relatively new WordPress startup in Europe, having released its first prototype in late 2014. The company offers its mobile app building platform to users for free via its <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/worona/" target="_blank">plugin on WordPress.org</a>. The platform turns WordPress sites into native mobile apps that users can publish to the app stores. Worona can also manage the process of publishing the app for a one-time 290€ fee.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Worona had more than 12,000 users from 150 different countries. After launching its new platform four months ago, more than 11,500 users have signed up.</p>\n<p>Martínez said that Worona differs from existing WordPress app builders in that it is free, user-friendly, completely open source, and extensible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We studied the WordPress ecosystem and the mobile distribution trends during the last three years and realized that other existing solutions, such as AppPresser, are just focused on one or two mobile channels, but not in all of them,&#8221; Martínez said. &#8220;This can be a problem for publishers, as they have to configure the different channels (apps, web apps, AMP, Facebook Instant Articles) one by one and take care of being consistent with all of them. After launching our own beta in 2015 and testing similar solutions, we decided to develop an all-in-one platform with the vision of becoming the leading solution for mobile distribution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is also aiming to create an ecosystem of extensions and themes for the platform, allowing third-party developers to create new solutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The strategy of creating a marketplace of extensions has been successfully accomplished by the WordPress ecosystem before (but not by any of our direct competitors),&#8221; Martínez said. &#8220;WooCommerce, for example, gives you access to a variety of extensions aiming to solve any problems related to your e-commerce. Because it is open-source, these features can be created by any developer or user. The bigger the community, the higher the range of solutions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is currently a team of five, including two co-founders, a marketing specialist, and two full-stack developers. Most of the team will be at WordCamp Europe. They hope the <a href="https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/" target="_blank">WCEU Paris Guide app</a> will be useful for attendees and also provide a good introduction to their product. If you have any feedback that would make the app more useful, make sure to <a href="https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/" target="_blank">comment on the announcement</a> and Worona may be able to incorporate user suggestions before the event.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:32:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.8 “Evans”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31595:"<h2>An Update with You in Mind</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4816" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/release-featured-image.png?resize=632%2C316&ssl=1" alt="" /></p>\n<h3>Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!</h3>\n<p>Version 4.8 of WordPress, named &#8220;Evans&#8221; in honor of jazz pianist and composer William John &#8220;Bill&#8221; Evans, is available for download or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.8 add more ways for you to express yourself and represent your brand.</p>\n<p>Though some updates seem minor, they’ve been built by hundreds of contributors with <em>you</em> in mind.

When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&ssl=1" alt="" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world? WordPress now draws your attention to the events that help you continue improving your WordPress skills, meet friends, and, of course, publish!</p>\n<p>This is quickly becoming one of our favorite features. While you are in the dashboard (because you’re running updates and writing posts, right?) all upcoming WordCamps and official WordPress Meetups — local to you — will be displayed.</p>\n<p>Being part of the community can help you improve your WordPress skills and network with people you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise meet. Now you can easily find your local events just by logging in to your dashboard and looking at the new Events and News dashboard widget.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Even More Developer Happiness <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" /></h2>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/">More Accessible Admin Panel Headings</a></h3>\n<p>New CSS rules mean extraneous content (like “Add New” links) no longer need to be included in admin-area headings. These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

The plugin offers a lightweight, elegant popup message for capturing email addresses, displaying a (fake) live chat, or announcing a sale or event.</p>\n<p>Bolinger designed it to be non-intrusive &#8211; it&#8217;s not the kind of modal dialog that obscures content with an animated box in the middle of the page. Holler Box appears at the bottom right-hand of the page by default.</p>\n<p>After finding other WordPress popup plugins to be too complex for his needs, Bolinger decided to create his own solution for displaying a quick notification on his websites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m a developer, and even adding a simple banner or popup to my site is not easy,&#8221; Bolinger said. I have to write the code, test locally, push to staging, test there, then push to production and do a final test. When I want to remove the message, I have to reverse the process. I’m busy, and that takes time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bolinger made it so that creating a new Holler Box is as easy as writing a new blog post. The content editing screen includes a meta box with options for customizing the display.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/holler-box-meta-box.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The &#8220;Advanced Settings&#8221; meta box allows users to set pages where the notification should be displayed, limit to logged-in only or logged-out visitors, set the display for new or returning visitors, and customize the delay based on time or scrolling. It also gives options for when the Holler Box should disappear and how often it should be shown to each visitor.</p>\n<p>Holler Box is capable of a wide range of uses. A few examples include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>(Fake) Live Chat with Opt-in</strong>\n<p>Show a live chat box to collect customer questions and emails, without having to actually deal with the hassle of live chat. As soon as your visitor types a question, an email opt-in pops up so you can follow up with them at a convenient time.</li>\n<li><strong>Polls and Forms</strong>\n<p>Embed anything into your Holler Box, including a feedback form or poll.</li>\n<li><strong>Interactivity</strong>\n<p>Add a link, video, contact form, or simple opt-in form that integrates with major email providers like MailChimp and Convertkit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is an example of how the MailChimp email opt-in form works:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/holler-box.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Holler Box also tracks impressions and conversions (link clicks and message opens) so that users can see how well their notifications are performing and optimize them as needed.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/holler-box/" target="_blank">free version on WordPress.org</a> has an impressive number of customization options, but Bolinger also plans to release a Pro version that will include additional features, such as an option for a header banner, more advanced display filters, automatic message deactivation, advanced email opt-in features, more conversion data, and support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Holler Box aims to be more stylish and easier to use than existing options,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;I use it when I need to make an announcement without spending a lot of time in a complex tool.&#8221; He said he could see the plugin working well side-by-side with well-established popup plugin competitors like OptinMonster.</p>\n<p>Bolinger said Holler Box is not affiliated with AppPresser, but he plans to use it as a sales tool on all of his sites. The plugin&#8217;s unique feature set is something he found missing in WordPress&#8217; marketplace for sales/conversion tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think Holler Box will increase sales and conversions without being as disruptive as other popups,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;The sale notification popup and faux live chat feature are really unique. It’s how I want to communicate with my audience &#8211; hopefully other people feel the same.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 01:37:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 276 – Interview with Jon Brown, a Traveling Digital Nomad";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=71482&preview=true&preview_id=71482";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-276-interview-with-jon-brown-a-traveling-digital-nomad";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2848:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me/">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href="https://www.wanderingjon.com/">Jon Brown</a>.

It&#8217;s stable and usable and runs on this site but we would love more people to test it out before we release a new version.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s just some of the new features and bug fixes we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The plugin was based on WP-Cache which stored cache files in a single directory, and those (legacy caching) files were for the most part stored the same way all this time but now they&#8217;re being placed in the supercache directories (<a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/177">#177</a>). This makes it easier to manage these files. The plugin doesn&#8217;t have to search through potentially hundreds of cache files for those that need to be deleted if a page updates or someone leaves a comment. Now all those files will be in the same directory structure the anonymous &#8220;supercache&#8221; files will be. I&#8217;m really excited about this feature as it makes caching for logged in users/users who comment and caching of pages with parameters so much faster now.</li>\n<li> We&#8217;re adding a <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">REST API</a> to the plugin because in the future not everyone is going to use wp-admin to take care of their sites. Take a look in the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/tree/master/rest">rest directory</a> for the code we&#8217;re working on.</li>\n<li> Debug logs now have a username and password to protect them from prying eyes.</li>\n<li> And many <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">bugs fixed</a> over the last few months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since &#8220;legacy caching&#8221; or &#8220;WP-Cache caching&#8221; is now more maintainable and faster we <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/issues/224">want to change the language</a> describing how the plugin caches and delivers pages. </p>\n<p><a href="https://odd.blog/files/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-07-at-17.35.25.png"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Currently the plugin asks you to choose between mod_rewrite, PHP and &#8220;Legacy page caching&#8221; which isn&#8217;t really useful. Most users won&#8217;t recognise those terms. It&#8217;s also not accurate as &#8220;legacy page caching&#8221; is active all the time as long as caching is enabled.<br />\nInstead we should have &#8220;Standard Caching&#8221; and &#8220;Super Caching&#8221;.

It was my first time to study at a public high school, grade 10, class 12. It was completely different than the private school I used to study at. It was big and crowded, with a minimum of 80 students in each class!</p>\n<p>At that time, I was trying to improve my personality and explore new opportunities. I wanted to live my life fully, not as the teenager that I was. A way to organize my thoughts and connect with new people was needed. I did not have a clue what to do until the moment I got the chance to use the internet and began to read online blogs of many interesting bloggers. The idea of blogging was fascinating to me. “Why not starting one?” I thought to myself.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>As days passed, I met four enthusiastic and ambitious schoolmates who became my friends till now.  Mohammed, one of them, was a relatively quiet and open minded person. My mates and I got to know him through MSN Messenger, and, surprisingly, he was studying in the next class! He was very absorbed in Web Development and was working on a custom CMS platform and some other web applications for his father’s clinic. I asked him about blogging software he would recommend. He strongly recommended Joomla and also suggested Drupal, WordPress and others. I tried them all.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress was so easy to use and out-of-the-box, although I had failed a few times while I was trying to install it locally. Once I had logged-in to the dashboard, honestly, I thrilled to pieces!</p></blockquote>\n<p>After some time, my friends and I decided to start a simple blog about Graphics Design using WordPress. It was my beginning to learn the basics of Web Development (HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP). Fortunately, Mohammed had a book that he lent me, and some PDFs, that I copied. We were constantly discussing and learning from each other during break times or in the afternoons. They were enjoyable and enlightening moments.</p>\n<p>I used to receive some positive messages as the developer of the blog we started and appreciative replies to my answers for some questions in <a href="http://ar-wp.com">Arab WordPress</a> community, a forum to share knowledge among Arab WordPress users. This encouraged me to start a small freelancing business with WordPress. It seemed a great idea to expand expertise, earn some money, and follow my passion!</p>\n<h3>Fitting It All In</h3>\n<p>Being a freelancer and a high-school student at the same time was not that easy as one would think! Sometimes I was working until 3:00 a.m. to finish a client project, and then woke up at 6:30 a.m. rushing to school. Most often, classes were so dry that led me to write PHP codes in every copy-book of mine! If you would like to try this at your school, remember to move yourself to the end of your class or be ready for any of your teachers’ mean reactions to keep you attentive! On several afternoons, I used to take naps to restore my energy and be ready to work at night.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Very rarely, I would have to stay out at internet cafés until 2:00 a.m. to upload/download things I needed because we had no Internet connection at home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For sure, this made my parents quite angry and obviously worried. Most importantly, I had neither a cell phone because of some strict rules in my family nor a national ID card because of the legal age requirement in Yemen. I was attempting to use my school ID card to receive money transactions, and guess what? I was lucky enough to manage it twice. But then I was asked to present a national ID. “ When will I turn 18?” I just had to overcome that obstacle, asking trustworthy friends to help.</p>\n<p>My clients were mostly from the Arab World, Europe, and USA. I had the chance to contact with many nice and outstanding people who not only boosted my experience but also showed me the way into some new opportunities and more success.</p>\n<h3>Support At Home</h3>\n<p>At the beginning, most of my family members thought I was playing, except my MOTHER. I remember the moment I told her about my fairly new business. She said, &#8220;Regardless of what it is, just do what you love and believe in!&#8221; However, I faced hard times trying to convince her I did not smoke as she smelled cigarette on my clothes whenever I got back home from those cafés! On the other hand, my father was the kind of man who stood backstage. He used to tell his friends how happy and proud he was of me. That was all what I needed from him.</p>\n<h3>Giving Back</h3>\n<p>On August 2012, I sent a message to Rasheed Bydousi, Arab WordPress community founder and translation editor of Arabic language, to suggest some ideas and ask to be a volunteer. He was very supportive and truly wise. We started discussing and working on some ideas for more than <a href="http://www.ar-wp.com/forums/topic/2119/">4 months</a>. In parallel with studying, working, and being a volunteer, I increased my efforts in translating, patching (helping in development), and reporting bugs for WordPress projects.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was very important for me to give back to the community I had taken a lot from.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I felt the need of holding a WordPress meeting in my hometown, Taiz, because of the lack of specialized people who would like to collaborate and share knowledge. In 2013, I invited local developers to a small meeting in a local coffeeshop called “AL-Rassef”.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1894 size-full" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wp-meeting-alraseef-coffeshop.jpg" alt="WordPress Meeting in Taiz, Yemen" width="960" height="720" /></p>\n<p>Afterward, I presented a lecture about WordPress at Taiz University, in the same lecture hall I used to be a student in by that time. It was a warm beginning but I couldn&#8217;t continue due to my work and the deterioration of the political and security situation.</p>\n<h3>Disruption</h3>\n<p>Since 2011, my country has been facing major political changes and instability. On April 2015, the Yemeni crisis has reached its climax and war started in my city, Taiz, and it is still going on! Some of my relatives had decided to move out of Taiz but my father chose to stay, hoping that war will stop quickly. We lived for months without public electricity or Internet. When the fight crawled to our area, we lived for weeks in the ground floor of our house, no way to go out, tanks firing from 300 meters away, airstrikes on nearby areas, and snipers shooting whoever dared to walk on streets. Many friends and innocent people were killed and some members of my family were hurt. We couldn&#8217;t sleep for days, fearing that at any moment they will knock our house door.</p>\n<p>I thought that was the end for me and all of my dreams. I was pretending to be cool and calm so my younger brother and two sisters feel better. I was telling jokes, reading books or watching movies when we got some power from my uncle generator. &#8220;Life of Pi&#8221; was one of the movies we had watched and everyone enjoyed it! I refused to hold a gun, &#8220;How could it help?! That&#8217;s not my role in life!&#8221; I was thinking.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was struggling to believe in tomorrow, no matter how it looked miserable and sad.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In one of the mornings, after a nearby airstrike, we got a chance to escape. I tried to hold every detail of our house, neighborhood and street. &#8220;Thank you for all great memories. I will definitely return,&#8221; I told my house, feeling torn apart back then! I only took my laptop, tablet, and few clothes, they were all what I needed to start over.</p>\n<h3>Starting Over</h3>\n<blockquote><p>“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.”<br />\n— Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>\n<p>After some time of catching my breath, I realized that I had to connect the dots, keep on following my dreams and aim higher. On May 2016, I moved to Sana&#8217;a, the capital city of Yemen, leaving the pain and frustration behind. I got to know some enthusiastic developers and we decided to establish a community called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ydevclub/">Yemeni Developers Club</a> for people who are interested in computer programming and have the passion for it. We hold a meeting on the first Saturday of every month to share ideas, answer questions, and help one another to innovate, learn, and grow. We are planning to have, in the near future, special meetings to discuss WordPress related topics and learn how to obtain the maximum benefit from it.</p>\n<img class="wp-image-1895 size-full" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/taiz_and_sanaa_poster.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="420" />Photos for Ta&#8217;izz and Sana&#8217;a cites, photographed by Mona Athubhani.\n<h3>Amazing Melting Pot</h3>\n<div class="_h8t">\n<div id="js_jl2" class="_5wd9 direction_rtl">\n<div class="_5wde _n4o">\n<div class="_5w1r _3_om _5wdf">\n<div class="_4gx_">\n<div class="_d97"><span class="_5yl5">I am sure that WordPress helps thousands of developers, including me, be more independent, involves them to be parts of it, and offers opportunities to serve people from around the world.</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress is such an amazing melting pot that contains people from everywhere, no matter how old they are, where they are from, or what languages they speak.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Become a Hero</h3>\n<p>Being a WordPress hero is not about programming skills or contributions size, it is all about the challenges we face and overcome.

At the click of a button, users can undo an action and restore a site&#8217;s database to a previous point in history without having to export and import MySQL.</p>\n<p>Borek Bernard, co-founder of VersionPress, says the move is the result of trying to overcome two major challenges: WordPress plugins and Hosts. WordPress plugins can alter a site&#8217;s database. Building <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/master/docs/Plugin-Support.md">in support</a> for the 40K+ plugins that exist in the repository has been a huge undertaking for the team.</p>\n<p>In order to use VersionPress, a webhost needs to have <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> installed and allow proc_open which it uses to interact with Git. Most hosts do not allow proc_open for security reasons or have older versions of Git installed, generating incompatibilities. &#8220;Over time, it became clear we needed our own environment to run VersionPress in,&#8221; Bernard said.</p>\n<p>All sites hosted on the platform run PHP 7 or Nginx, HTTP/2, and at least two Docker instances that auto-scale based on load. VersionPress.com includes the ability to set up staging and production sites using VersionPress&#8217; capabilities to merge changes between the two. Similar to <a href="https://getflywheel.com/why-flywheel/client-billing-transfer/">Flywheel</a>, billing can be assigned to a developer, agency, or client account. &#8220;The platform is geared towards WordPress developers and agencies but will help anyone who wants a fast, reliable WordPress site,&#8221; Bernard said.</p>\n<p>The model they&#8217;re using is similar to WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress. &#8220;A hosted service will provide resources to fund the development of the open source project and its long-term stability,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So it became a no-brainer at some point.&#8221; General availability for VersionPress.com won&#8217;t open until July but those who <a href="https://preview.versionpress.com/#preorder">pre-order</a> will receive a substantial discount.</p>\n<p>Bernard re-iterated that VersionPress will always be a free, open source project and that VersionPress.com is a major step towards bringing full version control of WordPress to the masses.</p>\n<p>The managed WordPress hosting space is well established and perhaps a bit crowded. It will be interesting to see how VersionPress.com compares to and fits in with the competition.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Jun 2017 21:45:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Matt: Remote Work Can’t Be Stopped";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47433";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"https://ma.tt/2017/06/remote-work-cant-be-stopped/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:489:"<p>Christopher Mims writes for the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-remote-work-cant-be-stopped-1496577602?mg=prod/accounts-wsj">Why Remote Work Can&#8217;t Be Stopped</a>, also riffing off the <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/05/ibm-goes-non-remote/">IBM shift I wrote about a few weeks ago</a>.

This causes the emails sent from your WordPress site to either go in the spam folder or sometimes not be delivered at all! Having a proper SMTP solution significantly increases email deliverability. I believe that once we implement the new UX and workflow, this will significantly reduce our support load since this is the #1 issue our users deal with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After a few months of email exchanges, Balkhi and Callum MacDonald reached an agreement for WPForms to purchase WP Mail SMTP. Balkhi would not disclose the exact financial details of the acquisition but said it was &#8220;a five-figure-deal because the plugin itself did not generate any revenue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>MacDonald had considered monetizing the plugin in the past but saw too many hurdles as he became less active in the WordPress space over the past few years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a few recent developments around SMTP that mean the plugin could use an update,&#8221; MacDonald said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have the time, so it made sense to move on at this point. I went over [monetizing] it several times. My conclusion is that it&#8217;s a lot harder than it looks. If I was still active in the WordPress space, it would make more sense, but I&#8217;m not, so monetizing was going to be a long road and hard work. It made more sense to sell.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Balkhi said he approached MacDonald because email deliverability was a problem that he was looking to solve for WPForms users as well as the larger WPBeginner and WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to build an add-on for WPForms because the problem isn&#8217;t unique to just us,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;It affects every form plugin and basically every WordPress website that sends an email of any kind (forgot password, user registration, etc).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last year Balkhi and his team acquired <a href="https://wptavern.com/syed-balkhi-acquires-google-analytics-by-yoast-renames-to-monsterinsights" target="_blank">Yoast&#8217;s Google Analytics and renamed it to MonsterInsights</a>. Over the past year the plugin has continued its growth from 10 million downloads at the time of acquisition to more than 16 million today.</p>\n<p>Balkhi reports that the MonsterInsights acquisition has been a success but the product was a very different type of acquisition from the one announced today. He said he has no plans to build an email deliverability service but rather wants to invest in a solution that will help his customers and others in the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin users can expect improvements to the plugin and a more &#8220;beginner-friendly&#8221; redesign, which Balkhi anticipates to release at the end of Q3 or Q4 of 2017.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of growing our WPForms&#8217; user base through WP Mail SMTP, that&#8217;s not our primary goal,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;Our top priority is to solve the email deliverability issue that our existing users and the larger WordPress community faces.&#8221; Balkhi said he hopes to leverage the 600,000+ user base to negotiate better deals with established email deliverability services.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Jun 2017 20:12:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WPTavern: Cory Miller and Dr. Sherry Walling Launch ZenTribes an Entrepreneur Peer Group";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71006";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"https://wptavern.com/cory-miller-and-dr-sherry-walling-launch-zentribes-an-entrepreneur-peer-group";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3202:"<p>Being an entrepreneur can be stressful, emotional, and lonely, especially during a rough part of life.

As the core team has more collective knowledge of working with React, they have reached out to developers with different experiences of using other frameworks in a  WordPress context.</p>\n<p>One of the chief concerns contributors have regarding Vue is the longevity of the project. I asked Vue creator <a href="http://evanyou.me/" target="_blank">Evan You</a> if he could weigh in on the topic to give WordPress contributors a better understanding of the project, specifically regarding his efforts to cultivate additional maintainers to help share the load of maintainership.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s important to look at the track record &#8211; Vue has been around for almost 4 years, and all the work has been done in public on GitHub so anyone can go and check the maintenance history,&#8221; You said. &#8220;While it has been largely developed by me, the current maintenance is a lot more community-driven. We have active core team members triaging most of the issues and a larger and larger percentage of the issues fixed by community PRs. So &#8211; yes, I had already been working on cultivating additional maintainers and will continue to do so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You currently receives <a href="https://www.patreon.com/evanyou" target="_blank">$10K/month from recurring Patreon donations</a> that fund his full-time efforts working on Vue. Prior to this he also worked at Google and Meteor. During his time at Google, some of the projects You worked on used Angular, which he said he found to be too heavy for his use cases at the time. He built Vue.js to be a more lightweight implementation of the concepts that he liked about Angular.</p>\n<p>You also recently said he has learned quite a bit from the React community, which has influenced some of his technical decisions in Vue 2.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I learned a lot from the React community &#8211; on both code and people. I hope everyone can be like <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov">@dan_abramov</a>. Peace.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Evan You (@youyuxi) <a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/869020366705799168">May 29, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;First, Vue 2 uses the same Virtual DOM based rendering model underneath, which was first pioneered by React,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Introducing a Virtual DOM allowed Vue to expose the power of vdom composition while maintaining the approachability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The React community is also very active when there are new problem domains being explored &#8211; e.g. state management and CSS management. There are many competing solutions and a lot of inspirations when I was implementing official solutions for Vue.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Evan You Addresses WordPress Core Contributors&#8217; Misconceptions about Vue.js</h3>\n<p>You said he has been following WordPress contributors&#8217; discussions on React vs Vue but would not offer an opinion on which is a better choice for the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My answer would obviously be biased, and honestly I&#8217;m not in the shoes of the WP core team so I don&#8217;t have enough perspective to make a choice,&#8221; You said. &#8220;However, I can provide feedback on some of the issues being discussed in hope of helping them make a better-informed decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You left a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/31/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-30th/#comment-32642" target="_blank">comment</a> on the most recent Javascript meeting notes with clarifications on a few misunderstandings about Vue.js. You addressed the point regarding &#8220;embracing JavaScript the language,&#8221; as some contributors think Vue&#8217;s templating language obscures the underlying JavaScript.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think &#8217;embracing JavaScript the language&#8217; is another primitive of React we don’t see in Vue,&#8221; Andrew Duthie <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1496150274570299" target="_blank">said</a> during the last meeting.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;s reply compares Vue&#8217;s use of templates as &#8220;syntax sugar for view representation on top of HTML&#8221; to what he believes to be a similar usage in the case of JSX as view representation on top of JavaScript:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The increasing richness of UI does NOT necessitate putting everything in JavaScript. On the other hand, just because Vue uses templates by default doesn’t mean it allows people to get by without learning JavaScript properly.</p>\n<p>Vue’s templates are compiled into JavaScript render functions under the hood and they are actually closer to JavaScript than to traditional string templating. It’s just a layer of syntax sugar on top of the underlying Virtual DOM representation. Think of JSX as syntax sugar for view representation on top of JS; Vue templates are syntax sugar for view representation on top of HTML.</p>\n<p>JSX/Raw JS does provide more flexibility when you need to apply direct manipulation of Virtual DOM nodes, this is why Vue also supports render functions. But this is not putting two opposing paradigms under the same tent – it’s simply allowing the user to skip the syntax sugar layer for more control.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You said the idea behind templating on top of render functions is to provide &#8220;better approachability,&#8221; a concern shared by many other proponents of WordPress adopting Vue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Users who are more comfortable with HTML and have simpler use cases could use the template, while users who are already familiar of JSX/render functions can leverage the full power of JS,&#8221; You said. &#8220;This would fit pretty nicely for the use of WP core: community users who care about approachability have an easier time getting started, while the core team have access to JSX/render functions for advanced use cases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You also addressed the concern of longevity by offering more information on Vue&#8217;s development processes. He confirmed that the current codebase is largely developed by him alone, but maintenance is spread across a core team with members all over the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other contributors have lower commit counts because their contributions are all submitted in the form of PRs and we use the &#8216;Squash and commit&#8217; feature on GitHub so each PR results in only one commit for the contributor,&#8221; You said. &#8220;We’ve merged close to 500 PRs in the core repo alone, and many more across the organization. Other repos under the vuejs organization, e.g. vuex, vue-router, vuejs.org are also largely maintained by dedicated team members.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You also offered clarification on questions of stability and future compatibility, as WordPress contributors presented concerns regarding breaking changes in the templating language in Vue 2.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This begs for some clarification: Vue versioning strictly follows semver,&#8221; You said. &#8220;The only time there had been breaking API changes post 1.0 was the 2.0 bump.

Ed Finkler, who founded OSMI in 2013, left his position as CTO of <a href="https://www.graphstory.com/" target="_blank">Graph Story</a> to work full-time on speaking, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. As of today, the campaign has raised more than $58,000.</p>\n<p>In addition to donations from individuals, OSMI has added several corporate sponsors, including CakeDC, Github, Digital Ocean, and Laravel. CakeDC has designated $1,000/month for 12 months to support Finkler&#8217;s salary. Finkler works together with a board of directors and a team of volunteers who also speak at conferences about mental health in tech. Several WordPress companies have also been involved in raising support for OSMI, including <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/opensourcingmentalillness-704978" target="_blank">WebDevStudios</a> and <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-elevation-is-focusing-all-content-on-mental-health-for-month-of-may" target="_blank">WP Elevation</a>.</p>\n<p>OSMI conducts an annual Mental Health in Tech survey as part of ongoing research. Last year&#8217;s survey received more than 1,500 responses and the results underscore the great need for removing the stigma surrounding mental illness in the tech industry. A few examples Finkler highlighted include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respondents believe it&#8217;s 6 times more likely that discussing a mental health issue with their employer would have a negative consequence, vs a physical health issue.</li>\n<li>Respondents are 3.5 times less likely to bring up a mental health issue in an interview than a physical health issue.</li>\n<li>87% believe being identified as a person with a mental health issue would hurt their career.</li>\n<li>Only 30% of respondents&#8217; employers provide information about mental health and how to seek help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OSMI offers all of the resources it creates for free. The funds raised in the campaign will help to create more tools, documents, videos, and other educational resources. Finkler is working towards engaging with more HR departments and educating more executive teams. He also plans to use the funds to do more research and employ additional experts to reach more people.</p>\n<p>For more information about OSMI&#8217;s efforts to improve mental health in the tech industry, check out Jeff Chandler&#8217;s <a href="https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-273-mental-health-awareness-with-bridget-willard-and-ed-finkler" target="_blank">recent interview with Finkler on the WP Weekly podcast</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Jun 2017 03:59:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It – Issue 21";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=71142&preview=true&preview_id=71142";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-21";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6022:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-50955"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>There’s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern.

The new desktop app is in early beta at version 0.2.0 with version 1.0.0 coming soon.</p>\n<p>Chassis Desktop was designed with a user-friendly interface suitable for beginners and experts alike. It was built by Bronson Quick and Ryan McCue using <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a> and contains code from the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" target="_blank">create-react-app</a> project.</p>\n<p>On first launch the app makes sure that Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed and then guides the user to create a new box. Setting up a new Chassis install or adding Chassis to an existing install is fast and easy with the simple UI. The app also includes keyboard navigation and a built-in terminal for quick access to more control over your box.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/add-new-box.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Over the years Chassis contributors have created an ecosystem of <a href="http://beta.chassis.io/extensions/" target="_blank">extensions</a> for things like MailHog, Photon, Memcache, debugging, and other software. These add-ons allow users to tailor their systems to their needs.</p>\n<p>Chassis Desktop aims to make it easy for users to manager their Chassis development environments without having to touch the command line. As it is currently in pre-release status, early adopters may discover some bugs. Beta testers are encouraged to <a href="https://github.com/Chassis/Desktop/issues" target="_blank">log any issues on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Jun 2017 03:24:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.8 Release Candidate 2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4765";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/wordpress-4-8-release-candidate-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1160:"<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 4.8 is now available.</p>\n<p>To test WordPress 4.8, you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.8-RC2.zip">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/?action=stop_on_copy&mode=stop_on_copy&rev=40866&stop_rev=40847">a handful of changes</a> since releasing RC 1 last week.

This is the second release since the project was <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-gets-official-wordpress-org-support" target="_blank">brought under the official WordPress umbrella</a> and the first major release since <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-names-alain-schlesser-new-co-maintainer" target="_blank">hiring Alain Schlesser as a part-time co-maintainer</a>.</p>\n<p>Splitting WP-CLI&#8217;s internal commands into separate packages moves the project closer to the goal of having official maintainers for the commands in the future. This new structure for the framework and its commands provides several benefits, as outlined by co-maintainer Daniel Bachhuber in the release post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While developing, the tests are only run for the specific component you’re working on, making the feedback loop much shorter.</li>\n<li>Individual command packages can be controlled and set up independently, opening up the opportunity for better collaboration.</li>\n<li>Hotfixes and intermediary releases can be published for individual commands, that can then be updated through the built-in package manager.</li>\n<li>Tests run really fast now.</li>\n<li>When you submit a pull request, you don’t have to wait two hours for the tests to run.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release also includes three new commands, along with dozens of command improvements and framework enhancements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>wp config get</code> lists constants and globals defined in wp-config.php</li>\n<li><code>wp config path</code> gets the path to wp-config.php</li>\n<li><code>wp db size</code> gets the size of the database and its tables</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version 1.2.0 had 43 contributors, a 95% increase in contributors from the previous release. One of the next priorities for maintainers is to improve the contribution workflow. Bachhuber said there are no plans at the moment to bring on additional paid co-maintainers, but they plan to start onboarding more volunteer committers. These are developers who are involved with the project on a regular basis but not necessarily daily or weekly. They have also created a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/good-first-issues/" target="_blank">Good First Issues page</a> for new contributors and have started working on a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/dash/" target="_blank">customized dashboard for committers</a>.</p>\n<h3>WP-CLI Has a New Logo</h3>\n<p>Bachhuber introduced the project&#8217;s new logo today, designed by Chris Wallace and his team at <a href="https://liftux.com/" target="_blank">Lift UX</a>. Having an official logo opens up the possibility for WP-CLI swag. Bachhuber said he worked with contributors to create a logo, because &#8220;people can develop stronger emotional affinity to brands with logos (myself included).&#8221; He is also interested in getting stickers created, particularly ones that glow in the dark, but has not yet found a producer. Bachhuber said he is hoping to have some preliminary WP-CLI swag for WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:17:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WPTavern: Pods 2.7 Beta Introduces Flexible Relationships, Rewrites Fields in JavaScript";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71009";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"https://wptavern.com/pods-2-7-beta-introduces-flexible-relationships-rewrites-fields-in-javascript";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2272:"<p>Pods Framework has released two new versions. <a href="http://pods.io/2017/05/30/pods-2-6-9-maintenance-release/">Pods 2.6.9</a> is a maintenance release that includes bug fixes for Pods Templates, Auto Templates, and Pods Shortcodes.

Limiting the discussion to prior contributors or collaborators can help keep input focused around the ideas of those who are already invested in the project.</p>\n<p>Reactions to the new feature have been mostly positive, although some users don&#8217;t anticipate using it much since <a href="https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments" target="_blank">GitHub added emoji reactions to conversations</a> last year. In addition to keeping threads from becoming unreadable with numerous +1&#8217;s, emoji reactions as an option for expression should help limit interactions from those prone to &#8220;drive-by&#8221; commenting.</p>\n<p>A curated repository of &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/nikolas/github-drama" target="_blank">GitHub Drama</a>,&#8221; which includes projects like Bower, Docker, Django, and NodeJS, lists many instances wherein temporarily limiting interaction may have changed the overall tone of the discourse.

Some users have also requested a convenient way for repository members to warn an individual without spamming the entire thread or to put specific users in a cool down period.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s a legit heated discussion and you limit it, then you&#8217;re just [going] to come back in 24 hours to very long, impossible-to-follow responses,&#8221; Kris Siegel, Senior Engineer at PlayStation, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14448871" target="_blank">commented</a> on the related Hacker News thread. &#8220;At least this has been my experience when people have left things to cool down them come back and need to respond to everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub is aiming to promote healthier discussions with the new interaction limiting feature, but every project&#8217;s community is unique and maintainers may not be able to predict user reactions to locking down an entire repository. If the feature is turned on when a new user is attempting to create their first pull request, it may hinder future contribution.  Open source project maintainers should carefully consider the effects of silencing non-contributors when using the feature.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 31 May 2017 20:35:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"HeroPress: Building A WordPress Career in India";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1874";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:136:"https://heropress.com/essays/building-wordpress-career-india/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=building-wordpress-career-india";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10706:"<img width="960" height="480" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/053117-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: Give your children the room to grow." /><p>6 years back, I’d have never thought I would be where I am right now. At that time, I was a 12-year-old wondering how softwares were made. Despite the fact that I was born in a middle-class Indian family, my parents never forced me to opt for something I wasn’t interested in. Unlike other middle-class Indian children, the bar of expectations wasn’t set that high and I think it turned out to be for the best.</p>\n<p>My parents always supported me and constantly motivated me to learn whatever I liked. Eventually, from wondering about how software was made, I started wondering same about websites. For some reason, I felt more interested in websites than software. For starters, I felt coding in HTML was easier than working with C/C++</p>\n<p>Now that I’ve bored you already, let’s get to know each other too. I am <a href="http://technobooz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suyogya Shukla</a>, a WordPress developer from Kanpur, India. I work with <a href="https://themeisle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThemeIsle</a> as a Support Ninja where I make sure our users are always happy with our products. Let’s go ahead now.</p>\n<h3>The Journey</h3>\n<p>At the age of 12; still in class 6th, I started to learn about web coding. I started with HTML and learned how to make a really basic webpage. After understanding the basic concepts I wanted to start making a website already. I went ahead and googled &#8211; “How to make a free website” and the webs.com&#8217;s listing lead the page. I immediately clicked on it and started playing around, until I realized that it was WYSIWYG editor and it wasn’t possible for me to customize it a lot (Not that I knew how to!)</p>\n<p>At this time I had no idea about domain names and hosting. I researched some more and was introduced to the process of putting your website online, but it cost money! I decided to make a small website locally and then show it to my dad hoping he’d be impressed and provide me with the money I needed to put it online. While learning HTML, I came across this cool language called  “CSS” which would apparently make a website look and work better.</p>\n<p>Next thing you know, I was all over w3schools.com and YouTube watching videos about CSS, playing with the examples and much more. It took me a good 2 weeks to understand the basic concepts. I could finally change fonts, play with colors and do a lot more! While I liked how I had more control when I coded my own website, I still missed the easy content management webs.com and other WYSIWYG tools offered. This had me thinking again. What free software can I use to have the same level of control over my website but is just as easy to use when it comes to content management? This, in turn, initiated another research and I was finally introduced to this awesome software which went by the name of “WordPress”!</p>\n<p>Over the years I would work on a lot of WordPress based websites and continue to learn more about it every day. I worked for various small design agencies, as a freelancer and a lot more until one fine day in 2016 when I saw a “hiring” notice on <a href="https://themeisle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThemeIsle&#8217;s</a> website and decided to give it a shot. After an initial trial period of some 2 weeks, I was hired. I worked part-time (three hours/day, to be exact) for a year because I had school. Two months back, I started working full time. I work with the support and development team (more involved in support as of now, but I eventually want to get into full-time development) where I continue to learn new things every day.</p>\n<h3>It’s a Real Career Option!</h3>\n<p>For everyone who thinks WordPress is just a blogging tool, you’re wrong! Sure, it’s a blogging tool but it is used for so much more. It’s a real career option with a lot of room for growth. Given you are passionate about WordPress and the technologies used in it, you’d be able to find a job easily.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The best thing about the WordPress ecosystem is the people. They’re just so nice!</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress ecosystem is indeed competitive like any other but in the best way possible. Even if you’re another company wanting to know how some other company manages things or what technologies they use, they won’t hesitate to tell you about it. Almost all of the WordPress enthusiasts go to WordCamps where they meet new people and share knowledge.</p>\n<p>Another good thing about choosing WordPress as a career? The flexibility. A large part of the people who work on WordPress, do it remotely. The company WordPress.com, Automattic, is a completely distributed team with people working from different parts of the world. Want even more reasons to choose WordPress? The earning potential. Companies in the WordPress ecosystem are known to pay generously and the best part? You get to work with the folks who are just as passionate about WordPress as you are.</p>\n<h3>Engineering isn’t the only way to go</h3>\n<p>This is for all the Indian parents who are pushing their children to join coachings for IIT and other examinations right now, without their children wanting to &#8211; DON’T. Engineering isn’t the only way one can get a job. Sure, there’s nothing wrong with it but forcing your children to do it because you think there’s no other way? That isn’t right.</p>\n<p>Introduce your children to WordPress, introduce them to the world of web programming and see if they like it. Why not promote them to do something they like than to burden them with the weight of engineering when they don’t like it?</p>\n<blockquote><p>For all I know if my parents had forced me into engineering I would’ve missed out on everything. Give your children the room to grow.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Make them learn new things, introduce them to WordPress and all other cool things ( not just tech related! ) and leave it up to them to choose a career path <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<h3>Working Remotely Is Fun</h3>\n<p>Let’s talk about working remotely now. It’s fun. You don’t have to wear a suit or any kind of uniform. You get to work in your PJs. Does it get any better than that? Oh wait, it does. You get to choose your working hours. You can decide to work 3hrs in morning and 3hrs at night or you can work 6hours at a stretch. Fellow night crawler? You can work at night. Apart from that, it gives you a lot of freedom. You can work from wherever you want. You can go to a beach and work. You can work while traveling, basically, you can decide to work from anywhere, anytime! It’s all up to you.</p>\n<p>Flexible working hours allow me to concentrate on learning new things on a personal level and maintain a healthy Work/ Life balance. But over time, you might get bored working from home. ( Not sure about you but it did happen with me! )</p>\n<blockquote><p>My two cents? Take some time out and go vacationing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Join a co-working space and see if that helps. All in all, I love having the freedom to work from anywhere and the best part still remains that I can work while wearing my PJs.</p>\n<h3>What’s Next?</h3>\n<p>Let me put it this way; I love WordPress. I have been doing some UI/UX work for a while now and I liked it. I am planning to learn more about it while learning more about WordPress development in parallel. For now, I am starting a small WordPress studio, <a href="http://madewithwp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Made With WP</a>, with my friends (and colleagues) &#8211; Hardeep and Rohit. <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/be-your-own-teacher/">You might remember Hardeep talking about it in his essay</a>. It’s the same project. I am working on my first WordPress theme and hope to see it in the theme directory soon. I am pretty good with HTML, CSS and comfortable with JS and PHP and I plan to learn more about them.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, I am the co-organizer of <a href="https://2017.kanpur.wordcamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordCamp Kanpur</a>. I have been to two WordCamps so far and run an active meetup in my hometown, Kanpur. I gave my 12th exams this year and I plan to study more about new things as much as I can. Also, I am 18 years old as I write this.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Building A WordPress Career in India" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Building%20A%20WordPress%20Career%20in%20India&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-wordpress-career-india%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Building A WordPress Career in India" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-wordpress-career-india%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-wordpress-career-india%2F&title=Building+A+WordPress+Career+in+India" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Building A WordPress Career in India"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/building-wordpress-career-india/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/053117-150x150.jpg&description=Building A WordPress Career in India" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Building A WordPress Career in India"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/building-wordpress-career-india/" title="Building A WordPress Career in India"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/building-wordpress-career-india/">Building A WordPress Career in India</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 31 May 2017 12:00:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Suyogya Shukla";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:110:"WPTavern: WordPress Core JavaScript Framework Debate Heats Up, Contributors Narrow Discussion to React vs. Vue";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=70985";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:119:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-debate-heats-up-contributors-narrow-discussion-to-react-vs-vue";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10702:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lego.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: oskay <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17425845@N00/2156889157">Small Parts</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>WordPress core contributors met this morning to continue the discussion on selecting a new JavaScript framework for use with new core features. The discussion on the Make/Core <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/" target="_blank">post</a> intensified over the weekend with more Vue.js proponents commenting to add their thoughts.</p>\n<p>Adam Silverstein and Andrew Duthie facilitated this morning&#8217;s meeting and began by opening up the discussion to include other frameworks such as Preact, Angular, and Ember. However, the discussion quickly narrowed to React vs Vue.</p>\n<p>Silverstein encouraged participants to remember that the new framework is for use with new features such as the new editor and that they will continue to use Backbone when it is the right tool, as well as in existing JavaScript. He also emphasized that the discussion pertains to a framework for core and developers are free to use whatever framework they choose to build plugins or themes.</p>\n<h3>Vue.js Proponents Consider &#8220;Ease of Learning&#8221; an Important Factor in Selecting a New Framework</h3>\n<p>Ease of learning is not among the criteria contributors identified for selecting a new framework, but it is one of the major concerns for Vue.js proponents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Vue can do everything that React can do and is much more approachable,&#8221; Justin Kopepasah said. &#8220;There is a huge adoption of Vue and growth does not show any signs of stopping. Some of the top open source frameworks have adopted Vue and it is used by the top three tech companies in China (including Alibaba). While I do agree that React is a good choice as well, it is not highly approachable by new developers and has Facebook behind it which can be very alarming for people in many ways (not just tech).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Justin Tadlock, a core contributor whose code and tutorials have assisted many developers learning WordPress, shared similar thoughts over the weekend on the Mare/Core post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve tried React on a few occasions. Even with over 10 years of programming experience, it was tough to grok for me. I can’t imagine trying to learn it as someone new to WP development.</p>\n<p>Vue is dead simple to start learning. I had a small app up and going in minutes. In a couple of hours, I was building some cool, form-related stuff without the docs.</p>\n<p>If it were entirely up to me, I’d push for WP to build its own JS framework that solves the problems specific to WordPress. But, if we’re going to choose an existing framework, go with Vue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matias Ventura, an Automattic engineer and contributor on both the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso" target="_blank">Calypso</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/" target="_blank">Gutenberg</a> projects, is a proponent of WordPress adopting React. He contends that considering which is easier to learn is the wrong focus for determining what WordPress&#8217; future interfaces will need.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion, instead of &#8216;easier to get started,&#8217; we need to look at robust programming paradigms and an expressive approach to coding interfaces,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;This is what I fundamentally take from Matt’s &#8216;learn JavaScript deeply&#8217; &#8211; the corollary being that WordPress becomes a platform for teaching JavaScript to new programmers, and we need to take that seriously, not just as a convenience to us in the short term.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura also noted that WordPress has historically not been successful in attracting JavaScript developers and the JS interfaces in core lack contributors when compared to the PHP side.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have an opportunity to make WordPress development more appealing to a newer generation of developers that learned how to code through JavaScript,&#8221; Ventura said. He encouraged other participants to examine the kinds of interfaces that WordPress needs to modernize and select the best framework for handling them in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The &#8216;easier to get started&#8217; [argument] seems a bit fallacious to me,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Easier to whom? At what cost to properly learning JavaScript? The demands of rich interfaces in web applications require a deeper understanding of the technologies used. That’s not something we can avoid. JavaScript cannot be seen as mere progressive enhancement anymore as it is the language in which modern interfaces are expressed.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Contributors are Concerned about React being Backed by Facebook</h3>\n<p>At the moment, React is more established and more widely adopted than Vue, but contributors are concerned about the framework being backed and licensed by Facebook. In addition to concerns over the interpretation of React&#8217;s additional <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-will-continue-to-use-react-js-in-calypso-despite-patent-clause" target="_blank">patent grant</a>, the company has been the source of numerous controversies regarding censorship, data mining, and privacy, among other issues. Opponents don&#8217;t want to see WordPress hitch its wagon to Facebook by using React in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The adoption of React is much more than adding a library to WordPress: it is adding the culture, business practices, and code base led by a tech giant,&#8221; Justin Kopepasah <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/#comment-32557" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;If we include React in Core, in a way we are asking users (from single site owners to enterprise) to accept Facebook has a key role in the future of WordPress. I have little doubt this will cause pause for some companies considering to adopt WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, other contributors have concerns about Vue.js&#8217; longevity, because it&#8217;s so heavily dependent on its creator Evan You. You <a href="https://www.patreon.com/evanyou" target="_blank">funds his efforts on Patreon</a> but the project doesn&#8217;t have any major corporate backing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m uncomfortable relying on a project run by a single person that could disappear,&#8221; React proponent and WP REST API co-lead Ryan McCue said. &#8220;Being run by a corporation with a stake in the game means long-term support and relative stability.&#8221; McCue also noted that React has a &#8220;a massive community of teaching and support out there for people learning.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Many Feel WordPress Selecting React as the New JS Framework is a Foregone Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Despite all the discussions in meetings and on Make/Core posts, many onlookers and community members are convinced that WordPress choosing React is a foregone conclusion. At the beginning of last week&#8217;s discussion it seemed that most core contributors are in favor of React, but a strong contingent of Vue proponents have turned out to add comments to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/" target="_blank">discussion</a>.</p>\n<p>Selecting React appears to be the only viable choice when the criteria from the beginning includes items like &#8220;proven in a WordPress context&#8221; and &#8220;alignment with Calypso.&#8221; Many have commented to say that the criteria is biased and they assume the decision was already made through the backchannels with a public discussion held for &#8220;optics.&#8221; Automattic engineer James Nylen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/876" target="_blank">commented</a> last week on an open ticket for the Gutenberg project, saying that &#8220;Per recent discussion in core Slack, WP core has basically decided to adopt React.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If this was truly meant to be a community discussion, then why is it taking place now?&#8221; WordPress developer Christopher A. <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-select-new-javascript-framework-for-use-in-core#comment-221446" target="_blank">commented</a> on our recent post that summarized the initial discussion. &#8220;Choosing a view framework should have happened before the first line of Gutenberg was written. It was known from the start that a view framework would be needed. It was Matt’s desire to get it off the ground as quickly as possible. The best way to accomplish this was to utilize Automattic developers who have experience with React.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress is selecting a JavaScript framework at a time where frameworks are rapidly evolving, but contributors involved in the decision said they will preserve the ability for theme and plugin developers to use any framework they choose to build their products. No framework was selected during today&#8217;s meeting and Andrew Duthie said he expects the conversation will continue at WordCamp Europe&#8217;s contributor summit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As to React vs Vue (vs Angular vs …), we’ve been discussing the arguments for and against each in the weekly chat, and we’re intentionally taking it slow,&#8221; Ryan McCue said. &#8220;The key criteria that we’ve picked come from what the project needs, and are not intended to bias the decision in a specific direction. Calypso and other projects are a strong signal towards React, but they’re not the ultimate argument (if they were, we wouldn’t even be discussing it).&#8221;</p>\n<p>McCue said he doesn&#8217;t see WordPress replacing the whole admin with Calypso in a way that doesn&#8217;t allow developers to use whatever they choose for their own extensions. The decision to adopt a JavaScript framework for core is more for making core developers&#8217; work easier. At this time, core developers working on new features have a greater knowledge of React than other frameworks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, we need to make a decision on what to use in core, and that decision directly impacts the people working on core,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;Picking one framework over another doesn’t mean the others are worse, it’s just us (as core contributors) trying to make our own development easier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A summary of the discussion should be posted to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/" target="_blank">Make/Core blog</a> soon and the discussion on selecting a new JavaScript framework will continue in future meetings.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 May 2017 23:15:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"BuddyPress: Building Bridges between Students and Educators in Nepal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://buddypress.org/?p=266185";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"https://buddypress.org/2017/05/building-bridges-between-students-and-educators-in-nepal/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9319:"<div><em>This is a guest post by Arjun Bhattarai (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aju29">aju29</a>), Founder and Developer of <a href="http://studentsnepal.com/">StudentsNepal.com</a>.

The site helps students find answers to popular courses and colleges by acting as a bridge between the students and educators/educational organizations.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>I started working on this side project in December 2014. I remembered I had very little information about courses and colleges I could choose from after finishing Higher Secondary level back in 2011. There were no websites that could readily help students to explore the various opportunities available in Nepal. There are still a lot of students in Nepal who have been brain-fed that studying abroad is the one and only option to be successful. My vision was to change this mindset among the young students of Nepal by informing them about the abundant opportunities and options available within the country.</p>\n<p>The goal for creating StudentsNepal is to increase communication among different students with different educational backgrounds while helping them to learn all sorts of information and get hold of educational resources. Communication and interaction are the core values of StudentsNepal and these are the features that help the platform stand out from rest of the educational websites. BuddyPress and bbPress have helped us to achieve these values in a cost effective and efficient way. The beauty of these plugins is that our members can create content and help to rank us higher with search engines.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>The investment to create StudentsNepal.com was very low, a fraction of my pocket money during my final years in college. It is now one of the top educational portals of Nepal. Since WordPress was so easy to master, my dev team and I were able to use most of our free time to create initial content and other valuable resources for our visitors &#8211; students, parents, and educators &#8211; rather than spending time/money coding from scratch or buying a proprietary platform.</p>\n<p>Before choosing BuddyPress, I researched open-source social network scripts and platforms. My shortlist included WordPress (BuddyPress), Joomla (JomSocial), and Drupal (social modules). It was clear to me, after reading a lot of support forum posts and articles, that the BuddyPress/WordPress combo was the way to move forward with my dream. I am really happy about this choice today. The other heavyweight plugins that I added were GravityForms, Sucuri, bbPress, and MyCred plus other smaller plugins for specific tasks.</p>\n<h2>Customizations &amp; Improvements</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Login and Registration Pages</strong><br />\nWe found out that the default login and registration pages made it difficult for members to log in and have kept site visitors from registering. We resolved the issues by installing the Gravity Forms plugin and adding log in integration via Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ as well as making the registration page more user-friendly.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266188" src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/studentsnepal-login.png" alt="studentsnepal login screen" width="1349" height="673" /></p>\n<p><strong>2. Newsletters</strong><br />\nI thought about adding a newsletter because I loved the way some of the blogs I subscribed to sent organized information and recent activities of the blog in a beautiful email format. I decided to add an optin form to start collecting names and emails 2 to 3 months after launching the site. During the first 6 months, only first names and emails were collected with the popup optin form. Later, I changed the optin forms to collect email addresses and phone numbers. I have been using the free package of mailmunch for optin forms (popups) and Amazon AWS for sending newsletters. The newsletter contains scholarship notices for different universities/colleges, student stories, youth events, and other useful academic information.</p>\n<p>The newsletters have become one of the most popular features for the community. We did a lot of testing for the positioning and timing of the popup to get the most sign ups. StudentsNepal had around 20,000 subscribers by the end of 2015. The number of subscribers started growing after I inserted the forms in all the subdomains. (news.studentsnepal.com, jobs.studentsnepal.com, quiz.studentsnepal.com, blog.studentsnepal.com). After 3 years, the site has 50,000+ subscribers.</p>\n<p>Currently, StudentsNepal sends 1 newsletter per week, and my dev team and I are planning to make it 2 newsletters per week. We had invited students and educators/institutions to contribute content for the newsletters and the response has been just great! Students, particularly, submit generously and regularly to benefit other members, subscribers, and online visitors.</p>\n<p>In addition, this project has also helped me connect with lots of awesome individuals and similar-minded startup owners.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Design and CSS tweaks</strong><br />\nOut of the box, BuddyPress has a plain and simple design and interfaces which can be customized easily. At the end of the day, the features and performance are what matters most to my users whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop. For me, due to extensibility and ease of customization, BuddyPress reigns as king when it comes to a free open source script for a social network.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266198" src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/Forums-Archive.png" alt="Forums Archive" width="1349" height="1957" /></p>\n<p><strong>4. Upgrading Servers</strong><br />\nStudentsNepal.com was on a shared hosting plan when I launched it in 2014. It took around 3 to 4 months to cross the benchmark of 500 visitors/day. After getting articles indexed in search engines and started getting higher ranks, StudentsNepal started getting a lot of visitors (especially from Google). Mid-2015 we upgraded to VPS hosting when the website’s articles and contents started getting listed on the 1st page of search engines and it started getting a couple of thousand visitors daily. Based on my experience, it’s a good decision to get a shared hosting plan while the site was starting out and then upgrade to more powerful hosting plan when data showed the increases in user engagement and participation.</p>\n<p>With a community of 9,700 registered members, 50k subscribers, and around 150k visitors/month, I am happy to say that our site runs smoothly with nary a downtime on all devices. If you install BuddyPress, you will need a bit more power on your server.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast Forward</strong></p>\n<p>Future plans for StudentsNepal.com include moving the Shopping and Jobs sections to separate domains and setting up a new site for online classes. I am testing Woocommerce, WP Job Manager, and Moodle for the other projects to expand our services to the community.</p>\n<p>If you are creating a site for any niche community and are not sure on which platform to choose, I definitely suggest using WordPress with BuddyPress. These have a lot of stable and robust add-on plugins to help you create awesome and feature-rich communities.</p>\n<p>StudentsNepal.com is the first website of its nature in Nepal and it has garnered a lot of media attention and praise. I received a lot of positive and encouraging messages from educators and students in Nepal for creating this platform. I’m just glad that the services provided by the site have been very helpful to so many Nepalese students as well to those who would like to study in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Thanks to WordPress and BuddyPress for making this site possible. If you want to learn more about the site or the other customizations implemented, please feel free to contact me.

I browsed the plugin directory to see if anyone had created a plugin that renamed Excerpts to TL;DR.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t surprised when I discovered <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/too-long-didnt-read/">TL;DR</a> created by <a href="http://ozh.org/">Ozh Richard</a>. It hasn&#8217;t been updated in more than two years so it won&#8217;t show up in casual searches. It simply renames Excerpt to TL;DR using a filter to replace a string with custom text.</p>\n<h2>Human Made Shares Handbook</h2>\n<p><a href="https://hmn.md/">Human Made</a>, a WordPress development agency based in the UK, has <a href="https://hmn.md/2017/05/25/handbook/">published</a> its <a href="https://handbook.hmn.md/">handbook</a> that includes on boarding practices, health and safety policies, and their hiring process.</p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s not a perfect fit for every one, it provides an in-depth look at the principles the company values.

Pagely, WP Engine, and SiteGround added HHVM hosting options in 2014 and early 2015. However, PHP 7 performance gains have been enough to preclude wider HHVM adoption.</p>\n<p>WordPress core developer John Blackbourn announced yesterday that the project has<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/25/hhvm-no-longer-part-of-wordpress-cores-testing-infrastructure/" target="_blank"> removed HHVM support in the Travis test suite</a> after April 2017 stats showed a mere several dozen WordPress websites running on HHVM. WordPress never officially supported HHVM but Scott Taylor made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27881" target="_blank">many improvements to core for better HHVM compatibility</a> three years ago. Blackbourn clarified on Slack that WordPress is not removing this support but rather will no longer include HHVM in its testing infrastructure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Support for HHVM itself hasn&#8217;t been dropped, but support for testing WordPress on HHVM has been dropped,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;HHVM usage is so minuscule (literally in the dozens according to update stats) that we can&#8217;t warrant the time needed to ensure the test infrastructure works.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The change isn&#8217;t likely to affect too many developers, but it&#8217;s an important milestone that signifies how well PHP 7 has been performing for sites that have switched. Blackbourn suggests those running WordPress on HHVM should consider switching to PHP 7+, as it is &#8220;far more widely supported and tested, and offers all of the memory and performance benefits that HHVM pushed forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The open source MongoDB project also announced yesterday that it will <a href="https://derickrethans.nl/mongodb-hhvm.html" target="_blank">no longer be supporting its HHVM driver</a>, saying it no longer makes good use of contributors&#8217; engineering time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the start of 2015 we began work on an HHVM driver for MongoDB, as part of our project to renew our PHP driver,&#8221; Derick Rethans, MongoDB engineer and author of <a href="http://xdebug.org/" target="_blank">Xdebug</a>, said. &#8220;Back then, HHVM was in its ascendancy and outperforming PHP 5.6 two to one. With such a huge performance difference it was reasonable to assume that many users would be switching over&#8230;With PHP 7 released, we saw very little use of the HHVM driver for MongoDB.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These announcements may be the start of more open source projects giving HHVM compatibility a lower priority. On the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40548" target="_blank">ticket</a> for removing HHVM from the test matrix on Travis, John Blackbourn thanked HHVM for its importance in helping move PHP forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The PHP world owes a lot to HHVM for helping it push it forward,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;Without HHVM, maybe we wouldn&#8217;t have seen such incredible performance gains in PHP 7.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 May 2017 19:07:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: Rainmaker Digital to Partner with Nimble Worldwide";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=70828";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://wptavern.com/rainmaker-digital-to-partner-with-nimble-worldwide";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3341:"<p><a href="http://rainmakerdigital.com/">Rainmaker Digital</a>, formerly known as Copyblogger Media, has <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/rainmaker-services/">entered into a letter of intent</a> to partner with <a href="http://www.nimbleworldwide.com/">Nimble Worldwide</a>, a marketing agency based in Dallas, TX. Assets from both companies will be combined into a new entity with Rainmaker Digital being the majority owner. Brian Clark, CEO of Rainmaker Digital, says the partnership enables them to transform from a Software as a Service provider to Software and Services.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People need sophisticated marketing technology, yes — but they also need done-for-them services such as design, content, and lead generation strategy,&#8221; Clark said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In that last year, we’ve explored several viable ways to do more for our customers and prospects as a hybrid technology and digital marketing service provider. After careful deliberation, we’ve come up with a path that allows us to expertly provide anything that a Rainmaker user needs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time both companies have worked together. Prior to <a href="http://rainmakerplatform.com/platform/tour/email/">RainMail</a>, Rainmaker&#8217;s in-house email marketing service, the company used Nimble Worldwide as its email marketing provider. Although the partnership brings in a number of new employees under Rainmaker Digital, Clark admits that they had to let some employees go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This deal provides instant access to an experienced team of digital marketing professionals and a network of talented contractors that ensures our service solutions are expertly crafted and delivered,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;This grows the Rainmaker team significantly, without the pain and uncertainty of building an agency from scratch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The change in business model unfortunately left four of our existing employees without positions, along with the loss of some of our own contractors. That was certainly no fun, and our operations leadership preserved every job possible despite the significant reorganization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Before the end of June, customers will no longer be able to purchase services à la carte. Instead, sales of the platform will be more hands on, bundled with services, and prices will significantly increase. Customers who start a free trial before the end of June will be able to use the platform at a cheaper rate and without the bundled service components.</p>\n<h2>Genesis Framework Remains a Priority</h2>\n<p>StudioPress, Synthesis, Copyblogger, Authority, and DCI are not part of the deal and remain separate entities. Clark says StudioPress sales are going strong and the Genesis Framework is still a priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our Synthesis managed WordPress hosting line will be folded into the StudioPress brand at some point, which shows how much we value StudioPress going forward,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Genesis is still in the hands of Nathan Rice, and he&#8217;s moving it forward at a faster pace than in years past when he had to divide time to work on Rainmaker. Now that he&#8217;s free from that, I&#8217;m excited to see where he takes the framework, which will continue to be a part of Rainmaker as well.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 May 2017 17:24:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: WordPress to Select New JavaScript Framework for Use in Core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=70794";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-select-new-javascript-framework-for-use-in-core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2892:"<p>WordPress core contributors have started collaborating more around their JavaScript efforts this year with regular core-js meetings. One item on the most recent meeting&#8217;s agenda was <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/" target="_blank">discussion on choosing a new JavaScript framework for use in core</a> as an alternative to Backbone.</p>\n<p>Contributors began by summarizing the criteria for evaluating framework options, includes factors like stability, longevity, maturity, adoption, accessibility, proven in a WordPress context, and extensibility, among others. Most of the discussion centered on the benefits and drawbacks of React vs Vue.</p>\n<p>The majority of those who participated in the meeting seemed to favor React, as it is already used with several major WordPress projects such as Calypso, Gutenberg, and Jetpack. WordPress&#8217; project lead, Matt Mullenweg, has publicly stated that Automattic is betting on React long-term. Mullenweg has also <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-tech-and-design-leads-for-new-focus-based-development-cycle" target="_blank">expressed a desire for Calypso, or a similar interface, to replace wp-admin</a> in the future. The company has been building its products on React for several years and is pot committed at this point when it comes to the framework.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock">@carlhancock</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/chriswallace">@chriswallace</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros">@mattmedeiros</a> Fair, but React is what us, Facebook, and many others are betting on long-term.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/808698242863165440">December 13, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>WordPress officially adopting a JavaScript framework will likely have a ripple effect that will influence how many products in the ecosystem are built and/or re-written. Proponents of Vue.js find it easy to learn and extend. Those who are advocating for React also cite its extensibility, stability, and its proven use with popular WordPress products.</p>\n<p>Contributors present for the meeting agreed they would be hesitant to commit a new framework to core without using it in some way for a core feature.

Many developers find JSON to be easier to use and less buggy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It has kind of made me sad these past five or ten years where it seems like development for the open web has slowed down a lot, particularly when we talk about the intersection of the Mac desktop and the open web,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;There just isn&#8217;t that much going on. I realized that one of the reasons is that people really hate XML and will go out of their way to avoid it. If they see XML APIs or XML stuff they&#8217;re not interested. That&#8217;s yucky, old, weird, hard stuff. But everyone likes JSON, all the cool APIs are JSON, even the not cool APIs are JSON. Everyone uses JSON.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Simmons said he is hopeful that the existence of JSON Feed will inspire developers to build new things for the open web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m hoping to see is that particularly Mac and iOS developers will consider doing new and innovative stuff on the open web, rather than writing yet another Twitter client or something that does something with Facebook. I want to see apps that do something with data that is not stored in somebody&#8217;s silos. I&#8217;m sick of corporate ownership of our data and of what I look at.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that Simmons decided to partner with Reece, who built <a href="https://micro.blog/" target="_blank">micro.blog</a> out of similar convictions regarding the open web. They worked together on the project since February and recruited a dozen different peers to review the specification before launching last week. Now that version 1 is published, its creators hope JSON Feed will make its way into other parts of the web and applications.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m hoping is that this is part of a bigger thing,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;The idea is to revitalize interest in the open web, in blogging, in syndication, and all of that kind of stuff.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Feed Readers are Beginning to Add Support for JSON Feed</h3>\n<p>Initial reactions to JSON Feed have been mixed. Many proponents wonder why it has taken so long for something like this to emerge, but critics ask why the web needs yet another syndication format. A few common criticisms on Hacker News that echo the sentiments of many who oppose the idea:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;We don&#8217;t really need another syndication format that no reader is going to support or support well for years.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14361977" target="_blank">@oefrha</a></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to make a new feed format in 2017, I&#8217;m sorry but copying what came before it and throwing it into JSON just isn&#8217;t enough.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14362286" target="_blank">@russellbeattie</a></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;One has to wonder whether Simmons is just trying to revive the old RSS ecosystem. &#8220;What do developers like these days, JSON? Let&#8217;s do RSS in JSON!&#8221; &#8230; This does not help. The real challenge these days is to replicate the solutions Facebook and Twitter brought to feeds (bi-directionality and data-retention in particular) in a decentralized manner that could actually become popular. Simply replicating RSS in the data-format du jour is not going to achieve that.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14363784" target="_blank">@toyg</a></p>\n<p>Despite critics, feed readers are already starting to add support for JSON Feed. The good news for publishers is that they don&#8217;t have to abandon their RSS feeds. Publishers can add support for JSON Feed alongside their existing feeds.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="https://json-feed-viewer.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">JSON Feed Viewer app</a> is built on top of JSON Feed. <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/post/160982162270/newsblur-now-supports-the-new-json-feed-spec" target="_blank">NewsBlur announced support</a> for the spec this week, along with <a href="http://blog.inoreader.com/2017/05/announcing-json-feed-support.html" target="_blank">Inoreader</a>, <a href="https://betamagic.nl/blog.html" target="_blank">News Explorer</a>, and <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2017/05/22/feedbin-supports-json-feed/" target="_blank">Feedbin</a>.</p>\n<p>Ben Ubois, founder of Feedbin, addressed one of the most common criticisms that feed readers aren&#8217;t likely to add support for the new JSON Feed spec because of the prevalence of RSS:</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the criticisms I’ve seen of JSON Feed is that there’s no incentive for feed readers to support JSON Feed,&#8221; Ubois said. &#8220;This is not true. One of the largest-by-volume support questions I get is along the lines of &#8216;Why does this random feed not work?&#8217; And, 95% of the time, it’s because the feed is broken in some subtle way. JSON Feed will help alleviate these problems, because it’s easier to get right.&#8221;</p>\n<p>JSON Feed also has a few additional features that existing formats don&#8217;t offer as easily. Simmons highlighted a few graphics-related features in his <a href="http://www.therunloop.com/4" target="_blank">interview</a> with The Run Loop podcast:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For instance, when you define an author, you can provide a URL of an avatar image. You can imagine someone doing kind of a Twitter-like view of a feed with avatars for different posts. It also has support for things like the URL of the featured image or banner image that you can specify for an article and your RSS reader can format it somewhat like it would look like if you had actually gone to the web page with the banner image in the background. It has a way to specify fav icons and a larger icon for your feed, which right now news readers have to guess what your favicon is or scrape the homepage looking for the metadata tag that says where it is. They have to make all these additional requests to find out some of the basic graphics about your feed or about the article and that stuff is all specified inside the JSON feed. People who actually use those get a much nicer interface on the reading side.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dave Winer <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/09/10/rssInJsonForReal.html" target="_blank">experimented with the idea of JSONified RSS in 2012</a>, but it didn&#8217;t catch on. His <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/21/reEvanWilliamsAndJsonFeed.html" target="_blank">reaction to the new JSON Feed spec</a> is &#8220;pretty neutral, kind of a shoulder shrug.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If developers have a hard time using XML in their apps, if that&#8217;s the problem, why not attack it right there?&#8221; Winer said. &#8220;Work to make it easier. I work in Node and the browser, and in both places XML and JSON are equally easy to use. The same could be done for any environment. In fact in the browser, XML is integrated deeply into the programming model, because the web is made out of XML.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In contrast, John Gruber thinks it&#8217;s the right time for the project and didn&#8217;t hesitate to add a JSON feed for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/json" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a>. He is eagerly supporting the JSON Feed project and is closely monitoring its adoption, publishing links to all the apps and feed readers that have already added support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this is a great idea, and a good spec,&#8221; Gruber said. &#8220;I even like the style in which the spec is written: for real humans (much like the RSS spec). If you want to see a real-life example, Daring Fireball has a JSON Feed. I’ve got a good feeling about this project — the same sort of feeling I had about Markdown back in the day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With the momentum from quick adoption by smaller news readers, JSON Feed has the potential to revive news syndication if some of the larger ones add support. Developers may even be more inspired to create new feed readers, given the ease of implementing the new spec.</p>\n<p>Manton Reece said that if JSON Feed had come along when blogging was at its peak, when there were fewer problems, he thinks there would have been less of a pressing feeling that the web needs a new syndication format.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m amazed with the traction it&#8217;s gotten,&#8221; Manton Reece said in a recent <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2017/05/episode-283-reset-all-the-things/" target="_blank">interview</a> on the Core Intuition podcast. &#8220;Of course some people will be negative about it and some people won&#8217;t like it. We certainly expected a lot of pushback on it. Everybody knows we need this, but it&#8217;s daunting. Who is going to try to push something like this when there are millions of RSS feeds? It feels like why even bother, it&#8217;s impossible. But things change over time and I think this is important enough and blogging is important enough that it&#8217;s worth making the investment now. Tomorrow the web is not going to be any different, but over time it might be a little different. Everybody knows that we need something like this but there hasn&#8217;t been something everybody could get behind until now.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 May 2017 17:51:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 274 – WordPress Commercials, Storefront, and the Customizer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=70802&preview=true&preview_id=70802";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-274-wordpress-commercials-storefront-and-the-customizer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2278:"<p>In this episode, <a href="https://jjj.blog/">John James Jacoby</a> joins me to discuss the news of the week.

It took me a day writing this essay as I wish I could write my whole mind in it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. – Arthur Ashe”</p></blockquote>\n<h3>So, here’s the start I had:</h3>\n<p>From my childhood, I’ve been wondering about Software Technologies. I always wondered about the constructions of website, and a program. It was the time when my mother <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yogita.patil.18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yogita</a>, just introduced me Google, the God of websites! All the curiosity I had was strengthened when using Google.</p>\n<p>Do you know what shaped my career? A search string on Google which said ‘How to make a website’! Not much useful, but the slow start I had was everything I need. That was 2012. (Me, 8 yrs old) When I tried an online web designing tool named SimDif. Just then, I got to know Weebly. I made my first permanent website, <a href="http://mathsbuzzz.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mathsbuzzz.weebly.com</a> and the curiosity went deeper.</p>\n<p>Now I thought of making a website myself, with no tool, with real programming! That was 2013. At that time, Microsoft Frontpage was nearly coming to an end of popularity. I embraced it. Though it couldn’t be called programming, but I liked it as I went one step further.</p>\n<p>I also learnt a bit of HTML from a book I had at home. It’s not even half of the story I’m telling. The time I was introduced to WordPress is much further. That’s 2016.</p>\n<h3>What in 2015?</h3>\n<p>I had a course of advanced HTML/CSS in 2015 where I got to know completely about Framing, Coding and Publishing a website. Then, I practiced it a lot and then thought about putting a step forward to PHP.</p>\n<h3>It’s 2016</h3>\n<p>Summer vacations were to get over and I had a course of PHP. There’s where I came to know about the REAL PROGRAMMING. I started making my first coded website and it was completely published in September 2015. It was my mother’s online store. And then, from November 2016, I made another website and completed the project in February 2016. That was my first blog, IQubex.com made with simple HTML/CSS and no PHP.</p>\n<p>I was actually equipped with HTML/CSS knowledge and was practicing PHP. But, I never got what I dreamt of. I dreamt of: “My exposure in Web Developing World. A community, which will help me in my needs. People, who will encourage me.”</p>\n<p>Dream became true.</p>\n<h3>When WordPress Came In My Life</h3>\n<p>Its still 2016, when striked an article in Newspaper about WordCamp Nashik 2016. My mother read it and thought that it would prove like a miracle for me. It was the start of October 2016. Nashik is my city and so it was always easy for me to attend WordCamp Nashik.</p>\n<p>It was for developers, bloggers and all the people who maintained their interest in Web Technologies. I knew that I too fit in that category.</p>\n<h3>Now came, 16th October 2016</h3>\n<p>We all know how cool experiences we get in a WordCamp. But this was the best for me as it was the first WordCamp of my life. From then, I migrated my blog to WordPress and got everything better. I saw how people program for WordPress and how big is the WordPress world.</p>\n<p>So, what did I miss? Nothing. I got a helping community. I got nice friends. I got people who are much more experienced and their knowledge which will help me throughout the life. What more? The best thing I received is Motivation.</p>\n<p>I used to write less on my blog as it was not equipped with PHP and was basic HTML/CSS. Due to that, I uploaded articles every now and then. But after the arrival of WordPress in my life, I wrote frequent articles, more beautifully, with more customization and with more interest. Then progressed my blog!</p>\n<h3>What next?</h3>\n<p>It was WordCamp Pune 2017 where I became the youngest speaker of WordCamp. I had an interview with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rahul286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rahul Bansal</a> Sir. He met me at WordCamp Nashik. So, I was able to talk in front of people. This is how my confidence got a boost positively.</p>\n<p>Now I run more than 3 websites and constructing more. I also developed a plugin on WordPress. Learning about making theme. I’m also aiming to be a good developer in future. After all, there is a lot of time left. I’m 13 yrs old.</p>\n<p>So, simply saying, before WordPress I was unaware of what I have to do in future, and now I can see the complete scene of my future career.

This paved the way for the team to change the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/headings-hierarchy-changes-in-the-admin-screens/">headings hierarchy</a>&nbsp;in WordPress 4.4. In WordPress 4.8, admin screens are more accessible&nbsp;thanks to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/">organizing the header text</a> on pages.</p>\n<p>The headers on admin screens typically contain more than text. For example,&nbsp;the Add New button on the Posts and Pages admin screens is included within the Posts and Pages header text.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>This makes it difficult for assistive technologies to help users navigate different sections of a page. The changes in WordPress 4.8 turn the headings on admin screens into their own elements.</p>\n<p>Before WordPress 4.8 the HTML looked like this:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;h1&gt;<br />\n    Posts<br />\n    &lt;a href="... /post-new.php" class="page-title-action"&gt;Add New&lt;/a&gt;<br />\n&lt;/h1&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Now it looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;h1 class="wp-heading-inline"&gt;Posts&lt;/h1&gt;<br />\n&lt;a href="... /post-new.php" class="page-title-action"&gt;Add New&lt;/a&gt;<br />\n&lt;hr class="wp-header-end"&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Andrea Fercia, WordPress core committer and a member of the accessibility team, explains what theme and plugin authors need to know.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If your plugin or theme follows the previous WordPress pattern of adding extraneous content to the main heading, please update your plugin or theme to make the heading cleaner,&#8221; Fercia said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All you need to do is move the extraneous content outside of the heading. WordPress 4.8 ships with new CSS rules to take care of the new markup structure and in most cases, no additional changes will be required.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These improvements are <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26601">three years</a> in the making. After much discussion and being punted to future releases, Fercia says the Accessibility team decided to handle the changes in smaller commits versus one large patch.

The objective of the event is to build websites for 10 different non-profit organizations in one day, an ambitious endeavor that requires a mix of different web and marketing talents working in highly concentrated teams. Participants help non-profits kick start their websites so the organizations can focus on doing what they do best &#8211; helping the local community.</p>\n<p>Hugh Lashbrooke, who is leading the organization of the event again this year, said the team has secured a new venue that will be better suited to a hackathon. <a href="http://workshop17.co.za/" target="_blank">Workshop17</a>, a collaboration and meeting venue, will host the charity hackathon&#8217;s 70 participants (7 people per team). The event is currently half-full and is recruiting another 35 participants.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing the event has done for me, and others in the community, is open us up to the rest of what is happening in the city,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;Our skills may seem pretty self-serving (building websites to make money), but they can be used for a lot more. Everyone who participates has so much fun on the day that I think they forget that it&#8217;s really work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s charities include the following organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tygerberg Association for Persons with Physical Disabilities</li>\n<li>Kidz Adventure Camp</li>\n<li>Little Lambs Christian Day Care</li>\n<li>Iliso Care Society</li>\n<li>Daughters Of Destiny</li>\n<li>Durbanville Children&#8217;s Home</li>\n<li>The Homestead Projects for Street Children</li>\n<li>Usiko Stellenbosch</li>\n<li>Rotary Club of Constantia</li>\n<li>ASSITEJ South Africa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cape Town WordPress community pioneered the concept of using WordPress to lift up local charities and this type of event has now spread to other areas of the world. As a member of the WordPress project&#8217;s Community Team, Lashbrooke has been working on making the do_action charity hackathons easily reproducible. It&#8217;s now part of the WordPress Community Program with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/" target="_blank">guidelines in the community events organizer handbook</a>.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="http://doaction.org" target="_blank">doaction.org</a> website lists the upcoming hackathons and takes care of all the manual admin work that Lashbrooke did for himself for the first couple of events. The functionality is built on top of his experience in running the events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There has been a ton of interest in the event from communities around the world, and we&#8217;ve already seen successful events in Austin and Johannesburg,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;More hackathons are scheduled for Pretoria, Beirut, and Montreal later this year. A few of the other cities that have shown interest and applied, but have not scheduled anything yet, are Fort Myers, Denver, New York City, and Ahmedabad, amongst others.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bringing the do_action charity hackathons under the official WordPress community program allows the team to offer logistical and financial support to organizers in the same way they already support WordCamp and meetup organizers. They do not have an official mentorship program set up yet, as the event types is still new, but Lashbrook said the community team does what it can to help hackathon organizers get started.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 May 2017 19:52:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"Matt: What’s in My Bag, 2017 edition";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47340";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://ma.tt/2017/05/whats-in-my-bag-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19635:"<p>I am a road warrior who has racked up several million miles over the past decade, and since I&#8217;m also working more-than-full-time running <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> (a totally distributed company) and leading <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> I need the ability to be productive wherever I can find a comfortable place to sit.

I&#8217;ve hated on Bose many times in the past, but these are decent and I get why people like them, especially the comfort aspect. I am listening to them as I write this. I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FE8VM8Q/?tag=photomatt08-20">Audeze EL-8 Titanium</a> for a while, which obviously sound better, but the lightning cable was unwieldy and it was annoying (and ridiculous) I couldn&#8217;t plug them into my laptop.

I dig this iteration: it has a little less padding on the shoulders, but the big front zipper pocket is super handy and in general it&#8217;s a lot more streamlined and water resistant. Om clued me in <a href="https://www.aersf.com/fit-pack-00006">to a similar one from Aer</a>, I don&#8217;t know who designed it first. Hat tip: Rose.</li>\n<li>So&#8230; there are two laptops, a custom prototype 13&#8243; Automattic-logo Macbook touchbar, and the stickered 15&#8243;. I generally only travel with one of these, the 13&#8243; for shorter trips or the 15&#8243; if I&#8217;m going to be on the road for more than a few weeks. The performance is just better on the 15&#8243;. My favorite things about both are the 4 USB-C ports, that you can charge on any of them, and the Touch ID. (Automatticians after 4 years of tenure can get a custom Macbook, which we now offer with the WordPress, Automattic, or Jetpack logo. I usually get the test ones to make sure the quality is up to snuff.) I carry around the larger 87W brick from the 15&#8243;, and keep the extension cable now so it&#8217;s easier to plug in on those weak plugs on planes.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016381AHE/?tag=photomatt08-20">Kindle Oasis</a>. I still love the Kindle. I&#8217;ve started listening to audiobooks this year and the integration with Audible is cool. The Oasis is great because of the real buttons and the fact that you can flip it to hold in either hand, but it&#8217;s been the most annoying model in a few generations because the screen brightness isn&#8217;t adaptive, and it gives &#8220;low battery&#8221; warnings when the extra battery cover is low but the actual device is not, which seems to defeat the purpose. Great form factor and ergonomics though.</li>\n<li>Passport, because you never know when you&#8217;ll need to leave the country.</li>\n<li>A pocket-sized <a href="https://www.baronfig.com/">Baron Fig</a> notebook, which I use in meetings to avoid my phone.

I actually <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XGD6CS4/?tag=photomatt08-20">switched to the 935</a> since this picture was taken, but my notes apply to both. (Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/03/garmin-forerunner-935-depth-review.html">a great review of the new 935</a>.) Garmin makes the best fitness smartwatches in the world right now. Aspects are clunky: the app is not the most elegant, the add-on watch faces and such leave something to be desired, the sleep tracking is way worse than Fitbit, and there is no fine-grained control over notifications. That said, the battery life goes 8-10 days (!) so I often don&#8217;t even bring the charger when I travel. The stats are unparalleled especially for running. It&#8217;s waterproof and can also track swimming and biking. Finally my favorite feature: the screen is always on. I know that sounds basic, but I have been driven crazy by years of Fitbit and Apple Watch require tapping or wrist gesticulations just to see the time. (Extra awkward in a meeting.) My hardcore fitness friends love this one too.

Hat tip Esther, Naoko, and my mom.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O5JARCI/?tag=photomatt08-20">Belkin car mount</a>, really handy when renting a car and navigating around. (3rd year)</li>\n<li>This is a more-expensive but not-better version of what I had last year, which I&#8217;ll quote and actually recommend: &#8220;This is probably the least-travel-friendly thing I travel with, but the utility is so great I put up with it. It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D4LBOV6/?tag=photomatt08-20">Sennheiser Culture Series Wideband Headset</a>, which I use for podcasts, Skype, Facetime, Zoom, and Google Hangout calls with external folks and teams inside of Automattic. Light, comfortable, great sound quality, and great at blocking out background noise so you don&#8217;t annoy other people on the call. Worth the hassle.&#8221; I leave the USB-C adapter attached to this. Cable still annoys me.</li>\n<li>iPhone 7 Plus, on Verizon, with a <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/phone-case-3-card/i7plus/caramel">Bellroy 3-card case</a>. If you&#8217;re a guy I highly recommend trying out a phone wallet case, it&#8217;s a game-changer to only have one thing to keep track of and not having a wallet in your back pocket is good to avoid getting misaligned. I have three cards in it, an Amex, a Visa, and my drivers license. In NYC I also squeeze in the Metrocard. Hat tip: Craig (a previous Bellroy model).</li>\n<li>The Japanese company <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TES88NK/?tag=photomatt08-20">Maruman makes this awesome grid-paper lie-flat notebook</a>, which I fill and occasionally draw in. I love this thing, and having a work area where I can have my laptop, mouse, iPad, and this notebook all set up next to each other is my happy place. The paper is soft. Hat tip: Brian.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D3ODTNO/?tag=photomatt08-20">9.7&#8243; iPad Pro</a> + smart keyboard cover on AT&amp;T. I didn&#8217;t expect to, but I really love this device. It gives me way more joy than my phone or my laptops. Gorgeous screen, long battery life, always connect, I can tether to it, write on it with the pen in 32, the keyboard is fast and silent, split screen is handy&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how to describe it. Like the Airpods, this product just excels in every area. I still have and need to use a laptop, but it&#8217;s less of my day and mostly because of some internal tools and security stuff we have.</li>\n<li>I ended up with this beast <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C316EIK/?tag=photomatt08-20">Cable Matters USB-c mega-dongle to cover ethernet, VGA, HDMI, and old USB</a>. Warning! <a href="http://www.asix.com.tw/download.php?sub=driverdetail&PItemID=131">To use the ethernet on MacOS you need weird drivers</a>. Hat tip: Amy.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m not sure why I started using this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H2RBQUG/?tag=photomatt08-20">Plantronics Voyager bluetooth headset</a>, but it&#8217;s really good. This might not make the cut next year as the Airpods are pretty good, but if I&#8217;m going to be on a regular (non-Facetime) phone or conference call for a few hours, this is what I turn to. Hat tip: An Uber driver.</li>\n<li>Lockpick set. (3rd year)</li>\n<li>An awesome <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/pc/en/2017/detail_toolstoys/tt_pen.html">Hobonichi Techo pen</a> (they have cool notebooks too), a sharpie (for signing fans&#8217; items), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016NY7784/?tag=photomatt08-20">Apple Pencil for the iPad Pro</a>.</li>\n<li>Two rings: one <a href="https://www.maisonmargiela.com/us/">Margiela</a> one which has my lucky number 11 circled (for a long reason related to their numbering system), and one with the WordPress logo that was also a swag prototype for a ten-year tenure gift. I might wear these to remind me of something I&#8217;m trying to remember or focus on during a day.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m digging this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EN9QK6G/?tag=photomatt08-20">Imazing 10k charger</a>: it&#8217;s a cool color, smaller and lighter than last year&#8217;s, has a USB-C port, and outputs well. I found I never needed the 20k capacity of last year&#8217;s, hence the downsize to 10k.</li>\n<li>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UWMCXD8/?tag=photomatt08-20">Aukey 30W / 6A travel wall charger</a> I wish was all USB-C ports. I sometimes trickle-charge the laptop off this overnight.</li>\n<li>A really mediocre Native Union two-port USB I got from TED. Not going to link since it&#8217;s not very good because of the way it plugs in. Since the photo I replaced it with the much-more-useful <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q873I3K/?tag=photomatt08-20">Aukey 2-port</a>, which I highly recommend and give away all the time.</li>\n<li>A pretty handy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GIQ8GOC/?tag=photomatt08-20">Ventev dashport car port charger that&#8217;s small and light</a>. I found myself rarely using the USB-C on last year&#8217;s so I opted for smaller size and less weight in this one.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VM2OPHY/?tag=photomatt08-20">Mintia mints</a> from Japan, yum. (I buy these there or ask friends to bring them back, they are much cheaper there than the cost on Amazon.)</li>\n<li>This rat&#8217;s nest of cables and adapters is embarrassing, and I will further apologize and rant in the epilogue.</li>\n<li>A random used mystery book I picked up at the <a href="http://paperhound.ca/">Paper Hound Bookshop</a> in Vancouver.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What blows me away making this list is that since last year almost every single item has changed, unusually high churn. I see now why y&#8217;all were tweeting me to update this post.</p>\n<p><strong>Two bonus items:</strong> Even in the summer I&#8217;ll often have something like <a href="https://shop.lululemon.com/p/mens-jackets-and-hoodies-hoodies/Surge-Light-Jacket/_/prod8431221">this light Lululemon running jacket</a> stuffed in a pocket for over air conditioned places or at the end of a flight when it gets chilly. I&#8217;m also currently testing out the <a href="http://www.choosemuse.com/">assisted meditation device The Muse</a>, but it hasn&#8217;t really stuck yet and I usually just turn to <a href="https://calm.com/">Calm</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ensuring network continuity:</strong> One thing you&#8217;ll notice is the iPhone is on Verizon, which has the best network in the US, the iPad is on AT&amp;T, and the Pixel is on Google Fi. This allows me to have a diversity of network access which is occasionally handy in the US and has saved my butt a few times when overseas. Whichever device has the best connection I&#8217;ll just tether the others to it. I almost never join coffee shop or hotel wifi these days, a good LTE connection is usually better.</p>\n<h3>USB-C Is Why We Can&#8217;t Have Nice Things</h3>\n<p>Oh, USB-C, I love you. You&#8217;re reversible, fast, and work for everything, like I can charge my laptop with almost anything, and many new devices like Google Wifi use you for power. The dangerous cable on Amazon thing seems to have worked itself out, and having 4 ports on the laptop is amazing, I can charge everything I need off it. But as you can see from the mess of cables and how many other legacy USB things I&#8217;m carrying around, we&#8217;re (still!) in this really awkward in-between phase for computing. First, there are no good retractable cables, especially ones that have USB-C on one end and Lightning or Micro-USB on the other. I wish my headset, headphones, sunglasses, and Kindle didn&#8217;t need Micro-USB, and I wish the Airpods, iPhone, iPad Pro, Magic Mouse would just give up on Lightning and support USB-C instead. But we&#8217;re in this liminal space, and the number one thing I hope is better by next year&#8217;s post is that the USB-C accessory world has flourished and I just have a couple of neat retractable USB-C cables and things like the battery, wall charger, and car charger in 34, 35, and 37 just have all USB-C ports. A boy can dream, right?</p>\n<h3>In Closing</h3>\n<p>Partly because the backpack is a little smaller, I&#8217;ve really tried to streamline and a lot of things from last year, like a small digital camera, the Chromecasts, travel router, etc I don&#8217;t bother carrying around in my backpack anymore. I hope these can get simpler and shorter every year. I tagged these with an affiliate ID for Amazon this year but mostly just to see if anyone actually buys stuff from these posts. I walk millions of steps a year with my backpack and wouldn&#8217;t carry something around unless I really believed in it, which is also why I&#8217;m always testing and trying new things. As you can tell a lot of this kit has evolved from recommendations, so if you have any please leave a note in the comments. I&#8217;ve also considered doing something similar for shoes, clothes, apps, suitcases, or toiletries, so holler if you&#8217;d like any of those. Alrighty, that&#8217;s it until next year!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 May 2017 17:05:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe to Halt Regular Ticket Sales May 31, Fewer than 400 Tickets Remain";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=70556";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-to-halt-regular-ticket-sales-may-31-fewer-than-400-tickets-remain";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2074:"<p>WordCamp Europe organizers will be <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/05/22/wceu-regular-ticket-sales-to-end-on-may-31st" target="_blank">ending regular ticket sales on May 31</a>. The event has sold out well in advance in previous years, but the logistics of managing a budget for an estimated 3,000 attendees prompted organizers to opt for ending ticket sales two weeks before the event:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As WordCamp Europe is a community event, we have to be extra careful with every penny that’s spent.

Even on widescreen monitors, the Customizer sidebar is only 300px wide.</p>\n<p>This limitation was one of the motivating factors behind the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-pane-resizer/">Customize Pane Resizer</a> feature plugin <a href="https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-feature-plugin-lets-users-resize-the-customizer-pane">created in 2015</a>. Although Customize component maintainers tried to get the feature plugin ready in time for WordPress 4.5, it didn&#8217;t make it.</p>\n<h2>In WordPress 4.8, the Customizer Sidebar Has a Variable Width</h2>\n<p>Weston Ruter, Customize component maintainer, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">announced</a> that the Customizer sidebar in WordPress 4.8 has a variable width.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ticket <span class="p2_hovercardify"><a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32296">#32296</a></span> was created to allow the sidebar pane to be user-resizable with a grabber just like the Dev Tools pane in Chrome can be resized,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a lot of back and forth, the scope was reduced to remove the user-resizable aspect and to instead address a more fundamental issue that the sidebar is exceedingly and unnecessarily narrow on high-resolution displays.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The sidebar has a minimum width of 300px and a maximum width of 600px. What users see depends on the width of their screen. I use a 21 inch widescreen monitor and the width of the sidebar on my screen is 345px.</p>\n<img />345 Pixel Wide Customizer Sidebar\n<p>While not a huge change, the extra width is noticeable. WordPress theme and plugin developers who have built custom controls into the Customizer are highly encouraged to test WordPress 4.8 to ensure that they display properly on large screens.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Custom controls in plugins and themes should utilize alternative approaches to doing layout than using pixel widths,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Use of percentage-based widths or flexbox will help ensure that controls will <em>appear properly in larger displays</em>, while also making controls <em>future-compatible</em> when the sidebar width could be user-resizable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to be able to adjust the width of the sidebar, check out the <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-pane-resizer">Customize Pane Resizer</a> plugin.

If the user is starting with a fresh store, the wizard will automatically import example products, create the homepage and set the correct template, assign the &#8216;full width&#8217; template to the cart and checkout pages, and remove unnecessary widgets.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/storefront-setup-wizard.png?ssl=1"><img /></a>Storefront setup wizard in the Customozer\n<p>This release also brings an overall design refresh that includes a new homepage hero section. The Storefront development team replaced the theme&#8217;s previous dark header background with a white one in order to put the focus on product images and improve the appearance of site logos. This small but important change gives the theme an overall lighter look and will be important for child themes to account for in their styles.</p>\n<p>Storefront 2.2 also adds subtle changes to typography, font weights, and button styles for a more minimalist, less-opinionated base design.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/storefront-design-refresh.png?ssl=1"><img /></a>Storefront design refresh\n<p>These changes are in line with what Matt Mullenweg said about Storefront when we interviewed him in December. He said Storefront was due for a design update and has a lot of potential for improvement.</p>\n<p>“With the Storefront theme there’s actually a lot we can do there to make it look like a really cool store out of the box, much like the default themes in WordPress,” Mullenweg said. “Part of the reason we change them every year is what was cool in 2012 is not cool in 2017. Fashions change, trends change. I think Woo should evolve Storefront in the same way. There’s kind of a look for independent stores right now. They’ve got a certain vibe. Let’s make it easy to do that vibe, so that you don’t have to be on Etsy or Amazon or one of the e-commerce monoliths to keep people coming to you and supporting your product.”</p>\n<p>Whereas many Storefront users had to opt for a child theme in order to have a more product-focused homepage in the past, the design and user experience improvements in the 2.2.0 release make the theme a more compelling option for use by itself.</p>\n<p>There are <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/" target="_blank">more than 90,000 stores using Storefront</a> as a base for their sites WordPress.org lists eight child themes using Storefront as a parent and WooCommerce.com also has a directory of <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/" target="_blank">free and commercial child themes</a>. This major release will likely affect all stores using these themes in one way or another. To avoid any surprise design updates, the WooCommerce team recommends that users test version 2.2.0 in a development environment before updating.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 22 May 2017 20:13:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 10:44:24 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 10:30:11 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130910223210";}', 'no');

It\'s different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Hi there! I\'m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin\' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n...or something like this:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href="http://localhost/ai/wp-admin/">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content.
